    "content": "<p>As soon as I saw on my ticket that I was going to be sat in the ominous &#8220;splash zone&#8221;, I should have known that I was in for a good time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It wasn’t until the end of the show that I got a light sprinkle, thanks to some pretty mesmerizing water bowl acrobatics, but I certainly didn’t have to wait until the end for the good times to start.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is <em>BRIEFS</em>, from the outrageously queer Australian performance troupe <a href=\"https://www.briefsfactoryinternational.com.au/\">Briefs Factory</a>. They’ve been around since 2008, but for the uninitiated, the <em>BRIEFS</em> experience is a delicious emulsification of <a href=\"https://www.thepinknews.com/culture/drag/\">drag</a>, dance, comedy, <a href=\"https://www.thepinknews.com/culture/theatre/\">theatre</a>, burlesque, acrobatics, circus arts and clowning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a lot to pack into a two-or-so-hour show, and it’s fair to wonder whether these are jacks of all trades, and masters of none. But trust, each artist here is a master, whether they’re spinning on a cyr wheel, dangling from aerial silks, or contorting their bodies into frankly absurd shapes. And they’re doing it all with an anarchic attitude every night until the end of the month at London’s HERE at Outernet.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-868351\" height=\"1010\" src=\"https://www.thepinknews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/BRIEFS-on-stage-at-HERE-at-Outernet-in-London-until-26-July.png?w=1024\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">BRIEFS on stage at HERE at Outernet in London until 26 July. (hereldn.com)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The evening is led by emcee, ringleader, bearded queen and Briefs Factory co-founder Fez, who delivers off-the-cusp, end-of-the-pier humour with just a dash of heart. Behind them at any one time you might see the flips, kicks and high heel clicks of bedazzled drag queens Nastia and Serenity. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could see the swishing of a burlesque fan held by co-founder Mark Winmill. Or, in the case of acrobatic clown Rowan, you might just see some penis. If you’re lucky enough to be perched in the front row, you may even find yourself drinking a cocktail through a straw that’s lodged through a pair of nostrils. Don’t ask us to explain, it all makes sense when it’s in front of you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is racy, risqué performance art, but it’s also just that: art. The level of skill, thought and intelligence in each routine radiates off each performer, and you’re left both completely in awe, eyes popped, and extremely – as Fez’s catchphrase would put it – <em>jealousssss</em> of their talent.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\"><div style=\"padding: 16px;\"> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DL-Dtd_qNWE/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\"line-height: 0; padding: 0 0; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; width: 100%;\" target=\"_blank\"> <div style=\"display: flex;\"> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"></div> <div style=\"display: flex;\"> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"></div> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"></div></div></div><div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"></div> <div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"></div><div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\"> <div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram</div></div><div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"></div> <div style=\"display: flex; margin-bottom: 14px;\"><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\"> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"></div> <div></div></div><div style=\"margin-left: auto;\"> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div> <div style=\"display: flex; margin-bottom: 24px;\"> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;\"></div> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; width: 144px;\"></div></div></a><p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; white-space: nowrap;\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DL-Dtd_qNWE/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\" target=\"_blank\">A post shared by HERE at Outernet (@hereldn)</a></p></div></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At one point, Fez notes that the group have failed to secure government funding back home in Australia as they aren’t seen as having &#8220;artistic merit&#8221;.

But, as circus performer Dale ate a balloon and two swords, I ate my words. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If <em>BRIEFS</em> doesn’t have artistic merit, the rest of us have no hope.

    "content": "<p>Sorry, Turkish tops, being a giver will provide no special treatment in Turkiye&#8217;s armed forces – in fact, it will hurt your chances of recruitment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Online rumours that the <a href=\"https://www.thepinknews.com/2025/01/14/turkey-erdogan-lgbtq-year-of-the-family/\">Middle Eastern country</a>, run by rampantly anti-LGBTQ+ president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, prefers its military personnel to be on the offence seem to have spawned from some false information in a viral social media post. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Posted to X/Twitter on Thursday (17 July), user @karmavoodo shared his shock at a screenshot that claimed &#8220;passive (bottom) gay men are not allowed to serve in the Turkish military&#8221; while &#8220;active (top) gay men are permitted to serve in the armed forces.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The terms top and bottom refer to positions in penetrative, often anal, sex. A &#8220;top&#8221; refers to an individual penetrating a person or people, while a &#8220;bottom&#8221; refers to a person being penetrated. Other roles include the &#8220;switch&#8221;; one who enjoys both top and bottom positions, and a &#8220;side&#8221;; one who doesn&#8217;t enjoy or engage in penetrative sex.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Wait is this real <img alt=\"😭\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f62d.png\" style=\"height: 1em;\" /><img alt=\"😭\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f62d.png\" style=\"height: 1em;\" /><img alt=\"😭\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f62d.png\" style=\"height: 1em;\" /> <a href=\"https://t.co/29GP2tRlX1\">pic.twitter.com/29GP2tRlX1</a></p>&mdash; Karma (@karmavoodo) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/karmavoodo/status/1945901926580703610?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 17, 2025</a></blockquote> \n\n\n\n<p>Expressive his shock at the apparent fact that <a href=\"https://www.thepinknews.com/2025/01/14/turkey-erdogan-lgbtq-year-of-the-family/\">Turkiye&#8217;s</a> armed forces recruits exclusively from the top bunk, @karmavoodo exclaimed in the post, which has gained over 7.5 million views at the time of reporting: &#8220;Wait, is this real?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, it&#8217;s not real, PinkNews can confirm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The screenshot appears to have been taken from the collaborative equality index site <a href=\"https://www.equaldex.com/equality-index\">Equaldex</a>. The site, launched in 2014, relies on users to update and verify the status of LGBTQ+ laws in countries across the globe, ranking them in a global equality index.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The entry featured in the viral post was submitted on 16 September 2013 during the site&#8217;s closed-alpha testing phase, using a 2009 Turkish progress report from the Commission of the European Communities as its source.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The report references the Turkish armed forces&#8217; homophobic policy which deems homosexuality a &#8220;psychosexual illness&#8221; and forbids out LGBTQ+ individuals from serving, adding that conscripts who do not want to serve in the army and instead declare their homosexuality in a bid to excuse themselves &#8220;have to provide photographic proof&#8221; and, in some cases, must &#8220;undergo humiliating medical examinations.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It does not, however, say that Turkiye military personnel must be exclusively tops to be eligible to serve in the armed forces.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Soldiers from the Turkish military marching in unison. \" class=\"wp-image-868345\" height=\"616\" src=\"https://www.thepinknews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Turkish-military-tops.jpg?w=1024\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Soldiers from the Turkish military marching in unison. (Getty)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The entry remained available to read on Equaldex for nearly a decade before it was changed in July 2021 to reference a 2020 report which highlighted the &#8220;psychosexual disorder&#8221; policy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was, however, changed yet again in 2022 to falsely claim personnel must provide &#8220;photographic evidence of them being on the receiving end of anal intercourse.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One user notes in a post following the correction: &#8220;Being <a href=\"https://www.thepinknews.com/2025/06/30/dozens-detained-in-turkey-during-banned-istanbul-pride-march/\">homosexual</a> in [the] military is indeed illegal, but there seems to be no necessity to show any evidence about anal intercourse.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The entry has been changed on several occasions over the past few years to remove and subsequently reintroduce a line about whether or not Turkiye troops need to be tops.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The current up-to-date entry reads: &#8220;Until 2015, in order to be exempt, gay men had to prove that they were homosexual by providing photographic evidence of them being on the receiving end of anal intercourse.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This, again, is not the case. While Turkiye citizens must provide photographic proof of their homosexuality to be exempt from military service, it is not required that the photograph involve anal intercourse in any way. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17474967\">The BBC</a> reported in 2012 that a young man was banned from serving in the armed forces after showing a photograph of himself kissing another man.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.thepinknews.com/2025/07/18/turkish-military-tops-debunking-article/\">Viral tweet claims gay men can serve in the Turkish military – but only if they&#8217;re a top</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.thepinknews.com\">PinkNews | Latest lesbian, gay, bi and trans news | LGBTQ+ news</a>.</p>",

This was certainly a highlight for not only her but the whole squad, who ran onto the pitch to hug her. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“She didn’t have doubters in our bubble. I think she had a very impressive performance,” Wiegman told <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/live/c78nq52j8dgt?page=2\">BBC Sport</a> in her press conference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“She had some very good saves in the second half.

Speaking to <a href=\"https://www.out.com/film/jp-karliak-smurfs-gargamel-interview\">Out magazine</a> recently, Karliak said that they were initially drafted in alongside a bunch of other voice actors for a table read, essentially so the team behind <em>Smurfs</em> could work out what the dastardly duo would sound like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Impressed with Karliak, they called him back, and got him to try voicing a few different, smaller roles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The whole time I’m thinking, I love that they love what I&#8217;m doing, but they&#8217;ll give me something like Smackity Smurf in the back row and I&#8217;ll have like two lines,&#8221; the actor told the publication.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, the team suggested that he could be Razamel, who is – if we’re being real – the less relevant of the two brothers. But as they attempted to record a scene where Razamel and Gargamel speak to each other, they realised they needed to source a placeholder for Gargamel’s voice, which would’ve taken some time.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, Karliak just whipped out their impression of Gargamel, and it left the producers &#8220;mind-blown&#8221;. Soon, the actor had scored both jobs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gargamel has always been a little bit on the fruity side, with the way he wears that ankle-length black cloak, rests his knuckles on his hips, and clutches his hands together.

She started off life as a human member of the villainous Foot Clan before realising the error of her ways and switching sides. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The character, who is bisexual, was later injured and in order to survive had to be given a blood transfusion from Leonardo, one of the main roster of TMNT. While this did save her life, it also transformed Jennika into a turtle. Thus, she became the &#8216;fifth&#8217; member of the TMNT squad. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>She would then later meet Sheena, the mutant pig lead singer of the band After the Bomb. The two bonded over a love of music and started a relationship. It was a significant moment for the TMNT comic universe as Jennika became the first turtle to openly identify as LGBTQ+. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last year Jennika took over the moniker of Nightwatcher. This is a vigilante guise previously occupied by Raphael, another of the central TMNT crew. She was revealed to have stepped into the role last year in <em>TMNT: Nightwatcher #1</em>. Jennika has led the series since then into the present. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\"><div style=\"padding: 16px;\"> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DGg-EWkRlvb/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\"line-height: 0; padding: 0 0; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; width: 100%;\" target=\"_blank\"> <div style=\"display: flex;\"> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"></div> <div style=\"display: flex;\"> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"></div> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"></div></div></div><div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"></div> <div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"></div><div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\"> <div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram</div></div><div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"></div> <div style=\"display: flex; margin-bottom: 14px;\"><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\"> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"></div> <div></div></div><div style=\"margin-left: auto;\"> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div> <div style=\"display: flex; margin-bottom: 24px;\"> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;\"></div> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; width: 144px;\"></div></div></a><p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; white-space: nowrap;\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DGg-EWkRlvb/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\" target=\"_blank\">A post shared by IDW Publishing | Comic Books and Graphic Novels (@idwpublishing)</a></p></div></blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a pretty A+ character,&#8221; one fan put in a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/TMNT/comments/o8lmcr/what_is_everyones_opinion_on_jennika/\">Reddit</a> thread. One fan, who said they were fed up with &#8220;this whole woke culture,&#8221; went on to praise Jennika. They said, &#8220;I actually see her as a beacon and link to the TMNT franchise for both older a new fans. Not only does she represent how Venus de Milo should’ve been done right, but she’s also something new for a new generation of fans from ALL walks and preferences of life.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Someone else wrote, &#8220;jennika isn&#8217;t too bad. i really like how her bisexuality was portrayed as a bisexual myself.&#8221; And another fan added: &#8220;I hope she’s in the next show with all the other new mutants. I think it would be a huge missed opportunity if she was left out. Great examples of [turtle].&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On an Instagram post about the hate Jennika recieves one person said she was fire. &#8220;Jennika is dope. People are wild for dismissing her so soon,&#8221; added another.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as is often the way with these things the character has fallen victim to hate simply for being LGBTQ+. People have described the character as an &#8220;insert&#8221; from artist and writer Sophie Campbell, who is trans, and designed Jennika. As well as some transphobic remarks, one person said Jennika equated to &#8220;deviant art fan faction&#8221; and the character was &#8220;a disgrace to TMNT.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a recent <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-14912369/tennage-mutant-ninja-turtles-lgbtq-character-sexuality-jennika.html\">Daily Mail</a> article on Jennika and her Nightwatcher run, the comments were also full of hate. One person said Jennika was &#8220;pretty disgusting,&#8221; while another said they&#8217;d had &#8220;Enough of the alphabet league.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s an unfortunate example of the times we live in where people feel free to hate on anything that displays and celebrates anything other than themselves. However, it&#8217;s in these displays that people can find representation and feel seen, which we know makes a massive difference in LGBTQ+ people&#8217;s mental health and self esteem. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>TMNT: Nightwatcher</em> is available now. </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.thepinknews.com/2025/07/18/tmnt-bisexual-character/\">Right-wingers have just found out about a queer Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle, and they&#8217;re not happy</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.thepinknews.com\">PinkNews | Latest lesbian, gay, bi and trans news | LGBTQ+ news</a>.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Sapphic songstress Reneé Rapp has just unleashed her new single &#8220;Why Is She Still Here?&#8221;, and girl, it’s a feisty one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Why Is She Still Here?&#8221; is the third single from Rapp’s wildly anticipated sophomore album, <em><a href=\"https://www.thepinknews.com/2025/05/14/renee-rapp-new-music-2025-bite-me/\">Bite Me</a></em>, and the song sees her haunted by the ex-lover of her current lover.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The sweeping, smoky track kicks off with a scalding lyric aimed at her girlfriend, who is keeping her ex in the picture.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;You can tell me you don&#8217;t love her, but you should probably tell her too,&#8221; Rapp purrs over the R&amp;B-tinged ballad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like she&#8217;s always in the room. She&#8217;s on that towel wrapped up around my head and that note that&#8217;s stuck to the mirror I shouldn&#8217;t have read,&#8221; she <a href=\"https://genius.com/Renee-rapp-why-is-she-still-here-lyrics\">rages</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As she belts into the bass-driven chorus, she questions: &#8220;No, it&#8217;s not fair&#8217; cause if it&#8217;s you and I, then why is she still here?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>While <a href=\"https://www.thepinknews.com/2025/07/18/renee-rapp-lie-detector-test/\">Reneé Rapp</a> is evidently furious at the ex for hanging around like a bad smell, it’s her partner who she’s really got gripes with. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say s**t when you introduced me as your friend, uh-uh. And yes, that&#8217;s what it is, but don&#8217;t you do that s**t again,&#8221; she warns on verse two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In typical Rapp fashion, the song reaches its peak when the lyrics are at their most honest, and their most savage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s funny &#8217;cause it didn&#8217;t feel like friends on the kitchen floor, no. I don&#8217;t take friends to the back of my tour bus,&#8221; she warbles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;God forbid I draw in the attention to questions you never answer, well, except for, &#8216;Who&#8217;s f**king you better?&#8217; You got me lowering standards,&#8221; she continues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coming in at just over two-and-a-half minutes long, &#8220;Why Is She Still Here?&#8221; is one of the shorter offerings in Rapp’s catalogue. Yet it offers the pop superstar the chance to show off her impressively versatile voice, and unleash the soaring vocals that she should now be known for.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Towa Bird and Reneé Rapp in blue and red suits.\" class=\"wp-image-802857\" height=\"515\" src=\"https://www.thepinknews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Towa-Bird-Renee-Rapp.jpg.jpg?w=1024\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Towa Bird is &#8220;obsessed&#8221; with girlfriend Reneé Rapp. (Getty)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Though Rapp is fairly coy about the subjects of her songs – ahem, &#8220;Poison Poison&#8221; – fans know that her current girlfriend is fellow musician, <a href=\"https://www.thepinknews.com/2024/08/28/towa-bird-confirms-relationship-renee-rapp-im-obsessed/\">Towa Bird</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pair hard-launched their romance at the Vanity Fair Oscar Party in March 2024, and met when Bird opened for Rapp on her <em>Snow Hard Feelings</em> tour in 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Why Is She Still Here?&#8221; comes after Rapp’s two previously released singles from <em>Bite Me</em>, with &#8220;Mad&#8221; released at the end of June, and the record’s lead single &#8220;Leave Me Alone&#8221;, which dropped back in May.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Bite Me</em> is released on 1 August.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Share your thoughts!</strong> Let us know in the comments below, and remember to keep the conversation respectful.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.thepinknews.com/2025/07/18/renee-rapp-why-is-she-still-here-lyrics-towa-bird/\">Reneé Rapp takes aim at her lover on scathing new song &#8216;Why Is She Still Here?&#8217;</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.thepinknews.com\">PinkNews | Latest lesbian, gay, bi and trans news | LGBTQ+ news</a>.</p>",

Rapp, a self-proclaimed <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/mean-girls-and-music-with-renee-rapp?srsltid=AfmBOoqI7CSTh1oQ4Qw_ncavKs9xLND3lGvA-W7hs0P2gu9a7-UoIfzg\">“serial flirt”</a>, was then asked how her change in attitude is going.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Really? Not good. I can’t believe I said that,” she said, smiling at the interviewer whilst hooked up to the polygraph. To this, the interviewer asked whether Rapp ever “subconsciously flirts and regrets it”.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I’m literally flirting with you right now,” said the “Why Is She Still Here?” singer, raising her eyebrows at the voice behind the camera. “You feel it.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\"><div style=\"padding: 16px;\"> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DMJS_wcJmP9/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\"line-height: 0; padding: 0 0; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; width: 100%;\" target=\"_blank\"> <div style=\"display: flex;\"> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"></div> <div style=\"display: flex;\"> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"></div> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"></div></div></div><div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"></div> <div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"></div><div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\"> <div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram</div></div><div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"></div> <div style=\"display: flex; margin-bottom: 14px;\"><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\"> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"></div> <div></div></div><div style=\"margin-left: auto;\"> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div> <div style=\"display: flex; margin-bottom: 24px;\"> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;\"></div> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; width: 144px;\"></div></div></a><p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; white-space: nowrap;\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DMJS_wcJmP9/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\" target=\"_blank\">A post shared by Vanity Fair (@vanityfair)</a></p></div></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After admitting that she “totally” flirts with people while not meaning it, she was instructed to tell polygraph operator Judd, ‘that shirt really brings out your eyes.

Suddenly feeling like his world&#8217;s been pulled out from under him, Otto begins to question want he&#8217;s actually into, and who he even is outside of his relationships.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-814417\" height=\"1029\" src=\"https://adabgmwwup.cloudimg.io/v7/_queerty-prodweb_/2025/07/ohotto-jonathanmichiels-jenniferheylen-ceyeworks-miloweiler-1544x1029.jpg?auto=format&#038;auto=compress&#038;width=1088&#038;org_if_sml=1\" width=\"1544\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Image Credit: &#8216;Oh, Otto!,&#8217; Streamz Belgium</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>But, with a little encouragement from Lente, he joins the dating apps for the first time, creating an online alter ego that gives him space to explore new sides of himself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, in turn, he gets to explore a whole new side of Brussels: The city&#8217;s surprisingly vibrant queer nightlife scene, one with plenty of new fun to explore in the forms of drag, leather, and anonymous dark room hookups.</p>\n\n\n\n  <blockquote>\n    <h3>Related</h3>\n                          <p>\n              <a href=\"https://www.queerty.com/from-90s-indies-to-short-lived-sitcoms-gays-reveal-the-most-underrated-queer-movies-shows-20250420/?utm_source=rss&#038;utm_medium=related_links&#038;utm_campaign=from-90s-indies-to-short-lived-sitcoms-gays-reveal-the-most-underrated-queer-movies-shows\">\n                <strong>From ‘90s indies to short-lived sitcoms: Gays reveal the most underrated queer movies &#038; shows</strong>\n              </a><br />\n              When we asked Queerty readers to submit their most underrated gay movies and TV shows, they understood the assignment!             </p>\n            </blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n  <div class=\" adb-inarticle\">\n      </div>\n\n\n\n<p>Also among the ensemble are hunky Dutch actor Tarikh Janssen, whose *<em>ahem</em>* <a href=\"https://x.com/omgblog/status/1945488377316610338\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">whole-hog scenes are making the rounds online</a>, and former EuroVision contestant Mustii, best known stateside as a judge on <em>Drag Race Belgique</em>, who <a href=\"https://x.com/Ivushka21/status/1940903553289408885\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">performs in drag in the series</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here, check out the Dutch-language trailer, and pro-tip if you don&#8217;t speak the language: Toggle on YouTube&#8217;s auto-translated captions so you can understand what they&#8217;re saying.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The seven-episode series debuted on Belgian streamer Streamz earlier this month, and though it&#8217;s not currently available to watch stateside (unless you know your way around international VPNs), the campaign to bring it to America starts here and now!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s because, even in an age of increased queer representation on our TV screens, our options are severely lacking in more grown-up dramas specifically focused on the LGBTQ+ experience. From the looks of it, <em>Oh, Otto!</em> is a show unafraid of tackling more mature themes, the intricacies of adult relationships, and showing a little skin, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, <em>Looking</em>&#8216;s been off the air for almost a decade, that <em>Queer As Folk</em> reboot never really got a chance to find its audience, and <em>Fellow Travelers</em> was only a one-and-done series.

For the early 1990s, that sort of on-screen representation was rare in mainstream entertainment. But as perhaps <em>the</em> quintessential &#8220;chaotic bisexual,&#8221; the character&#8217;s lurid, lusty angle on anti-heroism was controversial, to say the least.</p>\n\n\n\n  <div class=\" adb-inarticle\">\n      </div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite that, it was a <em>major</em> box office sensation, one that would inspire Verhoeven and screenwriter Joe Eszterhas to collaborate again on 1995&#8217;s equally exploitative—and even more deranged—<em>Showgirls</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though the latter film was a financial flop by comparison, both would go on to become obsessive fan favorites, especially among the gays who saw their unrepentant sleaze as high camp, and who were more than happy to claim Catherine Tramell as one of their own.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One can understand how, back then, the community would&#8217;ve been aghast as a queer woman so casually cruel and callous, her bisexuality an extension of her evident psychopathy. But, 30-plus years on, with a far greater depth of LGBTQ+ diversity in media, Catherine can be seen as a bi-con—a woman unafraid of using hers <em>gifts</em> to outwit straight men and end up on top&#8230; which, of course, we mean literally.</p>\n\n\n\n  <div class=\" adb-inarticle\">\n      </div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>So, with the announcement this week that Amazon MGM has tapped Eszterhas to write a so-called &#8220;anti-woke&#8221; reboot of the classic, we have to ask: What the hell does that even mean?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, <a href=\"http://Amazon MGM\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">according to <em>The Wrap</em></a>, the studio has secured a blockbuster deal for a $4 million payout to the screenwriter should the movie get made. There are no plot details yet, but the publication reports they are leaving the door open for Sharon Stone&#8217;s return.</p>\n\n\n\n  <div class=\" adb-inarticle\">\n      </div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In a statement to <em>The Wrap</em>, Eszterhaus had the following to say: &#8220;To those who question what an 80-year-old man is doing writing a sexy, erotic thriller: the rumors of my cinematic impotence are exaggerated and ageist. I call my writing partner the TWISTED LITTLE MAN and he lives somewhere deep inside me. He was born 29 and he will die 29 and he tells me he is &#8216;sky high up&#8217; to write this piece and provide viewers with a wild and orgasmic ride. That makes me very happy.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, respectfully&#8230;. <em>what??</em></p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-814911\" height=\"869\" src=\"https://adabgmwwup.cloudimg.io/v7/_queerty-prodweb_/2025/07/att9ocz1ci429gemx-original-1544x869.jpg?auto=format&#038;auto=compress&#038;width=1088&#038;org_if_sml=1\" width=\"1544\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Image Credit: &#8216;Basic Instinct,&#8217; Lionsgate Home Entertainment</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Eszterhas hasn&#8217;t exactly made anything that&#8217;s gotten attention, positive or otherwise, after<em> Showgirls</em>&#8216; flop, and he&#8217;s reportedly been living in Ohio with his wife and children for the last 30-some years. But he&#8217;s still managed to make some headlines, like when he called out Mel Gibson for anti-semitism after trying to work on historical epic about Judah and the Maccabees for the actor-turned-director.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, an avowed &#8220;independent centrist,&#8221; he&#8217;s never been one to hold back his political views, casting votes across party lines. In 2016, <a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/joe-eszterhas-trump-is-an-a-hole-but-im-still-not-voting-for-hillary-exclusive-video/\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">he famously told<em> The Wrap</em></a> he thought Tr*mp was an &#8220;a–hole,&#8221; but that, &#8220;a choice between criminals and an a-hole, I’ll pick the a-hole.&#8221; Oh no, Joe!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, whatever he&#8217;s cooking up for the new <em>Basic Instinct</em> is sure to be a doozy.</p>\n\n\n\n  <blockquote>\n    <h3>Related</h3>\n                          <p>\n              <a href=\"https://www.queerty.com/9-genuine-reactions-watching-basic-instinct-first-time-ever-20220320/?utm_source=rss&#038;utm_medium=related_links&#038;utm_campaign=9-genuine-reactions-watching-basic-instinct-first-time-ever\">\n                <strong>9 genuine reactions I had while watching &#8216;Basic Instinct&#8217; for the first time ever</strong>\n              </a><br />\n              &#8220;Basic Instinct&#8221; hit theaters in March of 1992&#8211;changing cinematic history (and how we look at ice picks) forever.            </p>\n            </blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that the &#8220;anti-woke&#8221; line doesn&#8217;t come direct from Eszterhas or anyone at Amazon MGM, but rather &#8220;an individual with knowledge of the deal,&#8221; per <em>The Wrap</em>, but why frame it that way to begin with? The original was a shlocky movie about a murderous seductress, so who would think a reboot would ditch those elements anyway? The &#8220;unsavoriness&#8221; of it all is why <em>Basic Instinct </em>became a hit to begin with!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, genuinely, what does &#8220;anti-woke&#8221; mean to these people? Just trying to make sense of it all hurts our brains.</p>\n\n\n\n  <div class=\" adb-inarticle\">\n      </div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re trepidatious, to say the least, so we&#8217;ll just end this with a note to Sharon Stone, who we are just going to pretend will <em>absolutely </em>read this:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sharon, girl, please don&#8217;t just say yes to this for an easy check. We&#8217;ve already agreed to pretend the terrible <em>Basic Instinct</em> <em>2</em> sequel doesn&#8217;t exist, so your legacy is secure. You love the gays, the gays love you. You&#8217;re busy with Season 3 of <em>Euphoria</em> anyway—you don&#8217;t need this!&#8230; Unless, of course, it somehow <em>is</em> a great script, in which case go crazy! We&#8217;re sort of gagged over the thought of you playing Catherine as a still sexually empowered diva in her 60s. Oh my god, you&#8217;d look <em>so fierce</em>. Um, wait, we guess what we&#8217;re trying to say is: use your discretion, and <em>please</em> don&#8217;t do this if it ends up being some weird, backwards, quasi-conservative screed against &#8220;cancel culture&#8221; or whatever.

Do they feature clients who look like you?” That visibility often signals real-world safety.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Avoid gendered pricing:</strong> “If you see gendered pricing (like ‘women’s cut’ vs. ‘men’s cut’), that’s a big red flag… Hair services shouldn’t be priced by gender—it alienates a lot of people.”</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Bring reference photos:</strong> Photos can help eliminate awkward conversations and ensure your stylist understands your vision, especially if you’re navigating dysphoria.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Choose stylists who collaborate, not dictate:</strong> “We meet people at all stages and our job is to make them feel comfortable and confident,” Mags explains. Great stylists provide options without making assumptions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>As one of Mags&#8217; clients put it, “My hair is a collaboration and makes me feel like my true self. I am so grateful to find a space that understands me and my identity.”</p>\n\n\n\n  <blockquote>\n    <h3>Related</h3>\n                          <p>\n              <a href=\"https://www.queerty.com/female-drag-queens-breaking-boundaries-20240527/?utm_source=rss&#038;utm_medium=related_links&#038;utm_campaign=female-drag-queens-breaking-boundaries\">\n                <strong>9 female drag queens breaking stereotypes in the world of drag</strong>\n              </a><br />\n              The art of drag is not exclusive to just one gender or sexuality.            </p>\n            </blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n  <div class=\" adb-inarticle\">\n      </div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gender-affirming haircuts are a form of care</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-814200\" height=\"1544\" src=\"https://adabgmwwup.cloudimg.io/v7/_queerty-prodweb_/2025/07/client-admiring-results-of-service-during-diffusion-with-salon-owner-and-stylist-mags-credit-brakethrough-media-1030x1544.jpg?auto=format&#038;auto=compress&#038;width=1088&#038;org_if_sml=1\" width=\"1030\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">A client admiring the results of a service during diffusion, with salon owner and stylist Mags | Photo: BrakeThrough Media</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Hair can be one of the first ways trans women and transfeminine people express identity outwardly.

When she met Kirk at the age of 17, she was thrilled by his ideas. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>She worked for Kirk and Turning Point USA during the first Tr*mp campaign in 2016, where her job was to &#8220;writ[e] articles specifically designed to scare people and&#8230; ratchet up the intensity of the political moment.&#8221; At the time, she believed in everything MAGA was selling—including the idea that Hillary Clinton was the second coming of Satan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I really thought I was saving America,&#8221; Caroline explains. &#8220;I thought&#8230;if we did not fight for these conservative values, America was going to fall apart.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, she went to college. While studying political science, she started to learn &#8220;how the world actually works.&#8221; That&#8217;s when the cracks in the MAGA firmament began to show for her. &#8220;A lot of conservative politics stuff just started to not make as much sense to me.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n  <div class=\" adb-inarticle\">\n      </div>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve ever wondered why Kirk and right wing influencers like him specifically prey on very young men and women, this is exactly the reason. The more educated a person is, the less likely they are to fall for what is essentially an ideological pyramid scheme disguised as a political movement. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For many young people growing up in sheltered conservative environments, the siren song of MAGA is difficult to resist. &#8220;For me, to question my political views was akin to having a crisis of faith,&#8221; Caroline says, explaining that where she grew up, being Christian and conservative went hand in hand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Luckily, Caroline found her way out, and now she&#8217;s ready to fight the good fight. She&#8217;s taking her experience as a past ultra-conservative and using it to help people in Texas find their way out of the dark. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this Texan, learning how much of Kirk and MAGA&#8217;s doctrines were based in oppression was a turning point. &#8220;I realized how much of it was built on cruelty&#8230;and blind obedience,&#8221; she says. And the best part is, she&#8217;s not alone.</p>\n\n\n\n  <div class=\" adb-inarticle\">\n      </div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@babyblue.tx/video/7527012885961248014\" class=\"tiktok-embed\"> <section> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@babyblue.tx?refer=embed\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"@babyblue.tx\">@babyblue.tx</a> <p>hi wow okay I really did not expect so much of a response to my first tiktok ever!

It’s a sharp left turn from the tenderness of “RIP KP” and a reminder that queer rage can be cathartic <em>and</em> catchy. Her new album <em>Girl Violence</em> drops September 12, and if this track’s anything to go by, it’s coming for blood.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">“Ceiling” by Roméo Elvis, Oscar and the Wolf&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n  <div class=\" adb-inarticle\">\n      </div>\n\n\n\n<p>Belgian queer superstar Oscar and the Wolf teams up with Roméo Elvis for the breezy summer anthem “Ceiling,” where Elvis slides on the track with a French rap amongst glossy production.

In Turkey, military service is mandatory for men, but homosexuality is grounds for exemption if proven. Culturally, passive (bottom) roles are seen as disqualifying/unmanly, leading to exemption, while active (top) roles are not, allowing service. Confirmed by 2025 UK Home Office report and BBC investigations.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The actual answer is more complicated.</p>\n\n\n\n  <div class=\" adb-inarticle\">\n      </div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Compulsory military service in Turkey</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Officially, all Turkish men between the ages of 20 and 41 are required to serve in the military for a period of between 6 and 12 months, depending on their rank. Most do it between the ages of 20 and 22. One of the exemptions to this is openly gay men. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no mention of tops or bottoms. However, different types of behavior carry different levels of stigma.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As explained by a 2021 <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1097184X19866874#sec-1\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">study</a>, “Until 2013, the Turkish Armed Forces … defined ‘homosexuality, transvestism, and transsexualism (sic)’ as ‘psycho-sexual defects’ under Article 17 and a cause for exclusion from the military service, otherwise compulsory for all male Turkish citizens since 1927. In 2013, the ‘list of illnesses and disorders’ was modified to exempt those with ‘visible sexual identity and behavioral defects.’… The medico-military gaze reads (in fact, produces) those men who are ‘visibly and excessively feminine,’ that is, who are effeminate, as … figures who pose a grave danger to the military order.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be excluded, men must offer some evidence that they are truly gay. This is to eliminate straight men who are just trying to avoid military service.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past, this evidence included providing candid videos, photographs, or subjecting themselves to humiliating medical examinations. However, since around 2015, this has largely been abandoned, and other forms of evidence have been requested, such as confirmation statements from family members.</p>\n\n\n\n  <div class=\" adb-inarticle\">\n      </div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">used to be. the only thing you have to do nowadays is to go to a psychiatrist and get a paper that shows you’re actually gay and you’re done. thank you. <a href=\"https://t.co/aSz3LuQ8I8\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://t.co/aSz3LuQ8I8</a></p>&mdash; venus (@bosluktakihesap) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bosluktakihesap/status/1946006661786677588?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">July 18, 2025</a></blockquote> \n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Mannerisms and stereotypes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a British government <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/6867d03281dd8f70f5de3b3c/TUR+CPIN+-+Military+service.pdf\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">report on Turkey</a> published this month, “A person is not exempt from carrying out military service purely on the grounds of their sexuality but can be exempted if a medical committee finds that the expression of their sexuality would lead to ‘undesirable’ or ‘uncomfortable’ situations, or undermine the ability of the Turkish armed forces.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The discrimination they might face rests largely on “​​their appearance and mannerisms, the way in which they describe their sexual identity, the extent to which they fit the stereotype of a gay man as understood within Turkish society; and the extent to which they will conceal their sexual identity and why.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why do some gay men want to serve in the military? Besides some perhaps wishing to serve their country, many others do it because they don’t want to out themselves. To claim exemption means a permanent mark is added to their record detailing the reason why they did not undertake military service. This can lead to discrimination or job rejections later in life. It largely precludes the ability to work in the Turkish government, for example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Others want to avoid military service but suggest they have to… well, camp it up at their interview to secure an exemption.</p>\n\n\n\n  <div class=\" adb-inarticle\">\n      </div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Femininity and masculinity</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once inside the army, it appears that intimacy-starved soldiers do have encounters with one another. It’s often accepted as something that happens when you have dozens of men spending weeks together in barracks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The limit is femininity,” one queer, ex-soldier told a researcher for this <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1097184X19866874#sec-1\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">report</a>. “The femininity is extremely important. There is no distinction between homo and hetero in the service. They suppose that if one is feminine, you can f*ck him. And, the top [insertive] participant can get along with that without being called f*ggot.…They think that ‘I can f*ck him and still be a real man’. But if you are effeminate, you cannot sexually approach anyone, not even for fun.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although many online have expressed amusement at the concept, it’s no laughing matter for gay men in Turkey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The country is led by the authoritarian regime of Recep Erdoğan. LGBTQ+ people have few legal rights or protections. Pride parades have been repeatedly banned in recent years, and LGBTQ+ advocates attempting any such marches have been arrested.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, there are instances of gay people being assaulted or expelled from the military once their queerness becomes known. This is especially true if they are viewed as unmanly.</p>\n\n\n\n  <blockquote>\n    <h3>Related</h3>\n                          <p>\n              <a href=\"https://www.queerty.com/mubi-scraps-film-festival-in-turkey-after-authorities-ban-it-from-screening-queer-20241108/?utm_source=rss&#038;utm_medium=related_links&#038;utm_campaign=mubi-scraps-film-festival-in-turkey-after-authorities-ban-it-from-screening-queer\">\n                <strong>MUBI scraps film festival in Turkey after authorities ban it from screening ‘Queer’</strong>\n              </a><br />\n              The Daniel Craig movie was too hot and too, well, queer, for Turkish officials.            </p>\n            </blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n  <div class=\" adb-inarticle\">\n      </div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Expulsion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One gay ex-soldier who served in 2013 recalled an instance that highlighted the double standards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Two men were caught by other soldiers while having sex.

My mom cried, my dad went silent for three full days, and there was a weird moment where they asked if I’d been “influenced by television.” (To be fair, I was binge-watching </em>Queer as Folk<em> like it was still airing in real time.)</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n  <blockquote>\n    <h3>How about we take this to the next level?</h3>\n    <p>\n      Subscribe to our newsletter for a refreshing cocktail (or mocktail) of LGBTQ+ entertainment and pop culture, served up with a side of eye-candy.<br />\n      <a href=\"https://www.queerty.com/newsletter/\"><strong>Subscribe to our Newsletter today</strong></a>\n    </p>\n  </blockquote>\n\n<p><strong><em>It took years for things to feel normal. We got to a good place eventually, but it was a long road of awkward silences, cautious conversations, and more emotional labor than I care to tally. As the first openly gay person in my family, I kind of broke the ice.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Then, last month, my younger brother came out — and my parents literally threw him a party. Champagne. Rainbow cake. My mom posted a selfie with him captioned “Love is love.” My dad even made a toast.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>I’m happy for him—really!&#8211;but I’d be lying if I said it didn’t sting. They rolled out the red carpet for him, while I was met with what felt like a cold brick wall. He got love, enthusiasm, and all the right words. I spent months trying to justify my existence.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>I keep reminding myself this is what I wanted — for it to be easier for whoever came next. But part of me feels erased. Like I did the work, and he got the reward. No educating, no explaining, just instant acceptance.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Am I a terrible person for feeling resentful about this?</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>The Icebreaker</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n  <div class=\" adb-inarticle\">\n      </div>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear <em>The Icebreaker,</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When queer people talk about progress, we often speak in collective terms: how far we&#8217;ve come, how much better it is now, how future generations will benefit. What we don’t always acknowledge is that progress comes at a cost, and some of us paid more than others. It’s not just laws and policies that evolve. Families do too. And often, it’s the first kid out who has to do the heavy lifting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You weren’t just coming out, you were educating, translating, challenging expectations, and softening resistance. You were managing your own emotions and your parents’ emotions, too. That’s not just bravery, it&#8217;s grueling emotional groundwork, the kind that makes room for others to arrive more gently. </p>\n\n\n\n  <div class=\" adb-inarticle\">\n      </div>\n\n\n\n<p>So, yes, watching your brother walk through a door you had to break down is bound to stir something. Hurt. Resentment. Maybe even jealousy. None of that makes you a terrible person. It makes you human.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And honestly? It’s okay to want some credit. Or a retroactive hug. Or even just an acknowledgment that your path was harder, and that you helped make his easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, I want to gently offer this: you did something beautiful. You changed your parents. Maybe not completely, and maybe not in the ways you needed back then. But you shifted something. And even if that feels frustrating or unfair, it also means you helped create a version of them that could show up more lovingly for someone else. It&#8217;s a quiet kind of legacy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It sounds like you’re not asking for a party or a toast, just to be seen. To have your experience acknowledged. That matters, especially for someone who had to fight to be visible in the first place. If you haven’t already, it might be worth having a low-stakes, vulnerable conversation with your parents. Not to rehash old wounds, but to say, “I love that you embraced him. I just want you to know it wasn’t that easy for me, and sometimes, I still carry that.”</p>\n\n\n\n  <div class=\" adb-inarticle\">\n      </div>\n\n\n\n<p>You’re not asking them to relive the past. You’re asking them to see it clearly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for your brother, he may not fully grasp what you went through. But I have a feeling he’ll benefit from hearing it, too. You paved the way. It’s okay to want some credit for how hard that was. It’s okay to grieve the version of coming out you didn’t get. And it’s definitely okay to feel what you feel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, hey, who says it’s too late for your own damn cake?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em><a href=\"https://www.queerty.com/tag/ask-jake\">Ask Jake</a>&nbsp;is our advice column by Queerty editor and Licensed Marriage &amp; Family Therapist Jake Myers.

Co-written and co-directed by Di Pace and his longtime friend Andrés Pepe Estrada (editor of the Oscar-nominated <em>Argentina 1985</em>), it&#8217;s an achingly romantic drama the grapples with the things left unsaid and the ways they can haunt our lives, for good and for bad.</p>\n\n\n\n  <blockquote>\n    <h3>Your dose of fabulosi-TEA</h3>\n    <p>\n      Subscribe to our newsletter for your front-row seat to all things entertainment with a sprinkle of everything else queer.<br />\n      <a href=\"https://www.queerty.com/newsletter/\"><strong>Subscribe to our Newsletter today</strong></a>\n    </p>\n  </blockquote>\n\n\n\n  <div class=\" adb-inarticle\">\n      </div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In it, Di Pace plays a filmmaker named Matias who is struggling to finish work on a feature about his time as a student at the United World College (UWC) in scenic Duino, Italy—the same school Di Pace actually attended in the &#8217;90s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Matias looks back, the film jumps through time to show us his school days (played in his younger years by <br />Santiago Madrussan) and his budding friendship with magnetic Swedish schoolmate Alexander (Oscar Morgan). Though the two grow close, a series of events pulls them apart, and it&#8217;s only decades later that Matias receives an opportunity to once again come face-to-face with the man who&#8217;s never left his imagination.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Further blending together cinema and the real world, Di Pace secured permission to film on the UWC campus in Duino, and heavily referenced his own VHS recordings from his time there to faithfully create the look and feel of the era. And, when it came to casting, he knew he needed the right person to play Alexander, someone who could channel memories of a specific person from his past while creating a complex character all his own. Thankfully, he found Oscar Morgan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With <em>Before We Forget </em>now playing in NYC and LA (and expanding to more cities on July 25), <em>Queerty </em>was lucky enough to chat with Di Pace and Morgan together about the powerful and sometimes challenging process of committing memory to film. In our conversation, the pair open up about how <em>Grease</em> and Google Maps led them to this story, and what it was like tapping into the nostalgia of young adulthood.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You can watch our full conversation with Juan Pablo Di Pace &amp; Oscar Morgan above, or read some highlights from our interview with the&nbsp;<em>Before We Forget</em>&nbsp;stars below.</strong></p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-814510\" height=\"772\" src=\"https://adabgmwwup.cloudimg.io/v7/_queerty-prodweb_/2025/07/bwf-juan-pablo-di-pace-1-1544x772.jpg?auto=format&#038;auto=compress&#038;width=1088&#038;org_if_sml=1\" width=\"1544\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Image Credit: &#8216;Before We Forget,&#8217; The Film Collaborative </figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n  <div class=\" adb-inarticle\">\n      </div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>QUEERTY:</strong> <strong>Juan Pablo, this is such a personal story, and a pretty meta one in that it’s about a filmmaker trying to make a movie about a formative relationship in his life. Did you always want to tell this story with the time-jumping modern-day framing device? Did the challenges the older Matias faces in revisiting this story mirror your own?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>JUAN PABLO DI PACE:</strong> I&#8217;ll tell it like it is: For me, falling in love for the first time with this particular person was traumatic, and I never in a million years thought that I would ever talk about it. In fact, my co-director Andrés Pepe Estrada I&#8217;ve known since the age of 12, and he became a very prolific film editor, including <em>Argentina 1985</em> which went to Oscars and the Golden Globes. For 30 years, we&#8217;ve been saying we need to direct our first feature, him and I, and so this was kind of an accident.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a mixture of many things. I wasn&#8217;t ready to do it, then 2020 arrived, and we all had time to think and ask ourselves the important questions: What am I doing? What do I want to do for the next 10 years—if I am alive, you know? And my [answer] was: I need to direct a film, I need to tell a story. I was in my parents&#8217; basement, and I found this VHS tape of that time—when I was 17 years old—and just watching this tape, and the people in the tape, and both the pain and the happiness that I saw in this five-minute piece, it just started sending me into [thinking,] &#8220;I could do something with this!&#8221; And so this tape became kind of like the heart of the movie being built, and it was both painful and wonderful at the same time.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-814508\" height=\"772\" src=\"https://adabgmwwup.cloudimg.io/v7/_queerty-prodweb_/2025/07/bwf-oscar-morgan-santiago-madrussan-1544x772.jpg?auto=format&#038;auto=compress&#038;width=1088&#038;org_if_sml=1\" width=\"1544\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Image Credit: &#8216;Before We Forget,&#8217; The Film Collaborative </figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n  <div class=\" adb-inarticle\">\n      </div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Oscar, knowing how personal this was for Juan, did that add extra pressure to jumping into this project and playing Alexander? Did you feel like you had to do justice to this real person—or at least the version of them in this movie?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>OSCAR MORGAN:</strong> Yeah, certainly. But, from the beginning, Juan Pablo was super clear that this was a new story. Yes, it&#8217;s based in [his] memories, but it&#8217;s its own thing, and I&#8217;m playing Alexander, which is a fictional character. On the other side of things, I got to see some of those tapes. As soon as I arrived in Duino, JP gave me a hard drive with hours of footage on it, which was amazing to sort of sink my teeth into, me and Santi [Madrussan] the other actor. We sat and just watched it like, <em>oh my god</em>—it&#8217;s pretty crazy, and it was really helpful having that footage</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>DI PACE: </strong>The character that Oscar plays, it&#8217;s a difficult character because you have to fall in love with him, just like the main character, Matias, falls in love with him. And at the same time, on paper, he shouldn&#8217;t be likable. He&#8217;s like this privileged, loud, obnoxious kid, and it could be annoying, right? And yet when [Oscar] first read it, or at least when I when I saw [him] for the first time in a Zoom, I was like, &#8220;Yeah, okay, this guy—we need this guy!&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n  <div class=\" adb-inarticle\">\n      </div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>MORGAN:</strong> Are you calling me annoying? [Laughs.]</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>DI PACE:</strong> You were not! [Laughs.] And that&#8217;s a difficult thing you had to do. Plus, you play the piano in the film. I mean, Oscar was a huge find, and I&#8217;m so, so glad that you were there. But, Oscar, from page to then having seen the tapes, did it make sense to you, what I wanted in my mind?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>MORGAN:</strong> I think so, yes, because when I read it first it, it quite quickly made sense to me. I felt like I was this character that, on the the page, this version of the character that I was, I felt very close to that, especially when I was a teenager. So I think I could kind of tap into something that was already in me and bring that out again. But then seeing the tapes, of course it&#8217;s not exactly what I had in my mind because everybody&#8217;s so unique—and this guy is so unique; I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anyone on the planet like him—but it gave me something else that I wouldn&#8217;t have come to otherwise.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\"><div style=\"padding: 16px;\"> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C_O_y66P2JW/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" style=\"line-height: 0; padding: 0 0; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; width: 100%;\" target=\"_blank\"> <div style=\"display: flex;\"> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"></div> <div style=\"display: flex;\"> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"></div> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"></div></div></div><div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"></div> <div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"></div><div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\"> <div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram</div></div><div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"></div> <div style=\"display: flex; margin-bottom: 14px;\"><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\"> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"></div> <div></div></div><div style=\"margin-left: auto;\"> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div> <div style=\"display: flex; margin-bottom: 24px;\"> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;\"></div> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; width: 144px;\"></div></div></a><p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; white-space: nowrap;\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C_O_y66P2JW/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\" target=\"_blank\">A post shared by Official account of “Before We Forget” the movie (@beforeweforgetmovie)</a></p></div></blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n  <div class=\" adb-inarticle\">\n      </div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>So, Oscar, what was it about this character you related to, and what about this specific story drew you in? </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time that I was reading the script and imagining what it might be like to make the film, I think—because I didn&#8217;t go to university, or any kind of like boarding school like that—I was feeling a lot of nostalgia for my school years and missing that sense of community and lack of responsibility. When I was reading the script, obviously, it&#8217;s set at the UWC, which is a real place, the one in Duino. I was all over Google, looking at pictures of it, and i&#8217;s completely trapped in that era of time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>I wasn’t at all familiar with these World Colleges prior to seeing the film; it’s such a specific time and place, yet I think Matias’s experiences—your experiences, Juan—are very universal. Can you tell me about what your time there meant to you, particularly as a place to explore your selfhood and your identity?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n  <div class=\" adb-inarticle\">\n      </div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>DI PACE: </strong>They say it&#8217;s education&#8217;s best kept secret. Just imagine a place which was built by a crazy, wonderful man called Kurt Hahn. And after WWII he said, &#8220;I want to build a school where I can bring one kid from each country and just have them at this age—16, 17—where their brains are still flexible, they&#8217;re not too judgmental, and they can learn about each other. And you get there by merit—it&#8217;s not about money. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, to little old me in Argentina, it just sounded so amazing to go to a completely different place, to be nobody, to start from zero. It wasn&#8217;t the easiest of childhoods, and so I really wanted to [start] from scratch. This place gave me that. I was given my first chance to direct the first musical that the school ever did, <em>Grease</em>, and I got to do, actually, what I&#8217;m doing now, which is I got to direct it <em>and</em> I was Danny Zuko at the same time, <em>and</em> I was casting it. And so you could say that that place, the United World College, gave me a front-row seat into what the rest of my life would be. And so this movie isn&#8217;t just a film about teenagers, but it actually was shot in a real place with the real students. I got to show that authentic magic that you can only see when you&#8217;re a student there, and what you know teenagers can feel like when they are all in the same boat without the eyes of adult adults on them. It&#8217;s quite cool, and everyone should have it at some point. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\"><div style=\"padding: 16px;\"> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CM-lpPVDhgb/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" style=\"line-height: 0; padding: 0 0; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; width: 100%;\" target=\"_blank\"> <div style=\"display: flex;\"> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"></div> <div style=\"display: flex;\"> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"></div> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"></div></div></div><div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"></div> <div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"></div><div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\"> <div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram</div></div><div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"></div> <div style=\"display: flex; margin-bottom: 14px;\"><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\"> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"></div> <div></div></div><div style=\"margin-left: auto;\"> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div> <div style=\"display: flex; margin-bottom: 24px;\"> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;\"></div> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; width: 144px;\"></div></div></a><p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; white-space: nowrap;\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CM-lpPVDhgb/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\" target=\"_blank\">A post shared by Juan Pablo Di Pace (@juanpablodipace)</a></p></div></blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Oscar, what was it like for you to step into this place, and inhabit this world that only a relatively small handful of people have gotten to experience firsthand?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>MORGAN: </strong>I really had been walking around the town on Google Earth [before filming,] and obviously having learned a little bit about the school, and even seeing the tapes that JP showed me, it did not take more than a few minutes to completely forget about the outside world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>DI PACE: </strong>You know, we used a lot of things that that Oscar naturally has, and they weren&#8217;t in the script, but we wrote stuff in—and we did that with a lot of situations. We would kind of come up with ideas, even between the days of shoot, and write scenes and add them to the schedule. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And even though there are elements of real people in history, we decided to just let the story be its own tale. When you&#8217;re making a movie, the film will tell you what it wants to be. You can write it, you can force things into it, you can put music and colors—but there&#8217;s one point when you&#8217;re editing where it is the movie itself that says, &#8220;No, no, I want to go this way.&#8221; There&#8217;s a real art in the edit of a film. And this one particular, we treat it as a ball of yarn that&#8217;s unraveling, and it goes this way, and then this way—which are the kind of films that I like to watch. That&#8217;s why I don&#8217;t like saying the word autobiographical, because it really isn&#8217;t. I just played with elements that are true and then changed stuff around.

There, the government suddenly moved to dismiss her application for asylum. It&#8217;s a tactic <a href=\"https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2025/07/drag-performer-arrested-by-ice-agents-at-asylum-hearing/\">now used frequently</a> by the Trump administration to strip migrants recently arrived to the U.S. of their pending immigration status to expedite their deportation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Baggio noted that it was clear the immigration judge hearing her case, Steven D. Caley, had met with the Homeland Security lawyer beforehand, and was aware that O-J-M had legal representation. However, the woman&#8217;s lawyers weren&#8217;t present for the hearing.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Caley assured O-J-M that, “If dismissed, you will not be in a removal … so the department would not be seeking your removal from the U.S.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The woman said she wanted to continue through the asylum process, but the lawyer from Homeland Security objected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Caley pressed O-J-M further, telling her, “The department won’t be seeking to remove you back to your home country if you accept the dismissal.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“OK,” O-J-M responded. “Then I want to.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She was immediately arrested by ICE officers stationed outside the door.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“O-J-M was affirmatively misinformed” and even “talked out of her concern” over the dismissal of her case, Baggio said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She asked a Justice Department lawyer if the Homeland Security lawyer at the immigration hearing knew O-J-M was going to be arrested afterward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DOJ attorney Ariana M.

A day after Colbert criticized Paramount, CBS cancelld his show, calling it &#8220;purely a financial decision,&#8221; despite his show being the highest-rated late-night show on TV.

Scott Walker (R)&#8217;s opposition to marriage equality, and speaking with Ted Olson and David Boies, the famed legal team who led the Supreme Court challenge against California’s Proposition 8 and the legal challenge to Virginia’s same-sex marriage ban.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Colbert said, “I believe we all must respect Walker’s privacy at this difficult time to be against gay marriage. This is a personal matter between him and his pollster. It is none of the public’s business what Walker decides in the privacy of his own governor’s mansion.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fact that Colbert did this, one year before the Supreme Court legalized marriage equality nationwide, showed his commitment to LGBTQ+ people.</p>\n\n\n\n  <div class=\" adb-ln-inarticle\">\n      </div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2016/04/colbert-owns-bathroom-weirdos-afraid-of-transgender-people/\">2016: Colbert mocks ‘bathroom weirdos’ for fearing trans people</a></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Colbert’s monologue hit back at the legislators nationwide who have made discriminating against transgender people a priority. As only he could, Colbert pointed out that the folks obsessed with where people go to the bathroom are, in fact, the true “weirdos.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These days, 19 states have laws restricting trans bathroom use. They&#8217;re part of the larger conservative crusade to eradicate trans people entirely from public and civic life.

In fact, in 2017, they passed a law making it illegal to display images of Putin as a &#8220;gay clown. Colbert highlighted the fact that there are so many images of Putin with effeminate clown make-up on the internet that even Russian news networks were unclear which ones were outlawed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To drive home his mockery — and to defy Vladimir&#8217;s attempts at censorship — Colbert depicted a cartoon Putin as a shirtless gay clown singing a deadpan version of drag queen RuPaul&#8217;s 1992 dance hit &#8220;Supermodel (You Better Work).&#8221; While some might find Colbert&#8217;s mockery homophobic, it delated Putin&#8217;s homoerotic strongman image and showed the silliness of his anti-gay censorship law.</p>\n\n\n\n  <div class=\" adb-ln-inarticle\">\n      </div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2021: <a href=\"https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2021/07/pete-buttigieg-denounces-terrible-attacks-trans-youth-stephen-colberts-show/\">Pete Buttigieg denounces “terrible” attacks on trans youth on Stephen Colbert’s show</a></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>During his show&#8217;s run, Colbert repeatedly featured out queer guests speaking out against policies affecting the LGBTQ+ community. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In one such segment, out Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg spoke out forcefully against the nationwide attacks on trans youth and to highlight the progress made for LGBTQ+ people working in the U.S. government.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“These kids have the courage to be who they are, and they just want to be accepted and go to the bathroom like everybody else, and play sports like everybody else and be – <em>live</em>,” Buttigieg said. He worried that anti-trans legislation conveys the message that trans people shouldn’t exist, something trans kids may believe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Years before the Republican party began targeting trans kids worldwide, Colbert provided a platform to speak in defense of this young, vulnerable community.</p>\n\n\n\n  <div class=\" adb-ln-inarticle\">\n      </div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2024: <a href=\"https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2024/09/late-night-comedians-clown-black-nazi-perv-gop-candidate-mark-robinson/\">Colbert clowns GOP “Black Nazi perv” candidate Mark Robinson</a></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2024, North Carolina&#8217;s then-Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson (R), was running to become his state&#8217;s governor. His campaign was alarming, considering his <a href=\"https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2024/03/who-is-mark-robinson-what-is-his-stance-on-lgbtq-issues/\">many anti-LGBTQ+ statements</a>, such as calling homosexuality “an abominable sin,” <a href=\"https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2021/11/mossback-lt-governor-says-straights-superior-gays-sermon/\">comparing LGBTQ+ people to cow dung</a> and Satanic demons, and saying trans people <a href=\"https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2024/02/gop-official-tells-transgender-people-to-defecate-on-public-street-corners/\">should defecate on public street corners outside</a> rather than using bathrooms matching their gender identity. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, after CNN dropped a bombshell report highlighting racist and antisemitic comments that Robinson allegedly made on an explicit adult online forum, Colbert piled on the well-deserved mockery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“[Robinson] referred to himself [in the online forum] as &#8216;a Black Nazi,&#8217; meaning Donald Trump might say he’s a very fine person, but would not rent an apartment to him,” Colbert joked, referencing both Trump’s infamous August 15, 2017 comments that there were <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/article/2019/apr/26/context-trumps-very-fine-people-both-sides-remarks/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener external\" target=\"_blank\">“very fine people”</a> involved in a Charlottesville, Virginia white supremacist rally and also the infamous 1973 federal lawsuit brought against Trump for alleged anti-Black discrimination in his housing developments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Colbert called Robinson’s comments “off-topic for a porn message board,” adding, “Mark, come on, stay focused. We’re not talking about Hitler right now. We’re debating if that delivery man was fairly compensated for the pizza he delivered with&nbsp;<em>extra sausage</em>.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robinson horribly lost his race, thanks to the bad press he received in the weeks and months leading up to his election.</p>\n<p><em>Subscribe to the <a href=\"https://www.lgbtqnation.com/about-lgbtq/mail-list/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>LGBTQ Nation newsletter</strong></a> and be the first to know about the latest headlines shaping LGBTQ+ communities worldwide.</em></p>",

Tony Wied (R) chatted amiably with a correspondent for the outlet, a black-helmeted Van Orden rode through the background of the shot on his ubiquitous 2019 Harley Davidson Softail Slim and revved the engine loudly.</p>\n\n\n  <blockquote>\n    <h3>Insights for the LGBTQ+ community</h3>\n    <p>\n      Subscribe to our briefing for insights into how politics impacts the LGBTQ+ community and more.<br />\n      <a href=\"https://www.lgbtqnation.com/newsletter/\"><strong>Subscribe to our Newsletter today</strong></a>\n    </p>\n  </blockquote>\n\n<p>&#8220;That’s your as***le buddy, Derrick Van Orden. You can put that on the news,” Pocan said to their interviewer as he watched Van Orden pull up and kick the stand.</p>\n\n\n\n  <div class=\" adb-ln-inarticle\">\n      </div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“Hey, Derrick!” Pocan said, raising his voice, “Classy as always, man. We love it. Thank you.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Van Orden then stepped into frame, already angry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Have you lost your mind? You know people read this stuff,” Van Orden said to Pocan, as Wied was caught wide-eyed in the middle of a simmering feud between the two reps that was now boiling over.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The day before, Pocan had posted an on-the-nose <em>New Yorker</em> cartoon authored by another Wisconsinite, Paul Noth, skewering Medicaid cuts the so-called &#8220;Big Beautiful Bill.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;You no longer have Medicaid, so expect a big, beautiful bill,&#8221; a doctor says to a patient in the caption.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pocan called it &#8220;great work&#8221; by Noth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the early hours of Wednesday morning, Van Orden responded to the post, retweeting with the cartoon, &#8220;Wisconsin is getting $1,000,000,000 a year plus up to Medicade [sic] per year. If any Wisconsinite loses coverage it will be due to incompetence, mismanagement, and malice by @GovEvers.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Seek mental health counseling,&#8221; he advised Pocan.</p>\n\n\n\n  <div class=\" adb-ln-inarticle\">\n      </div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Wisconsin is getting $1,000,000,000 a year plus up to Medicade per year.<br /><br />If any Wisconsinite loses coverage it will be due to incompetence, mismanagement, and malice by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GovEvers?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@GovEvers</a> <br /><br />Seek mental health counseling. <a href=\"https://t.co/3YkuiG9IFA\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://t.co/3YkuiG9IFA</a></p>&mdash; Derrick Van Orden (@derrickvanorden) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/derrickvanorden/status/1945356481416626443?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">July 16, 2025</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As the sun rose over Washington hours later, Pocan started his day with a response fileting his obstreperous opponent: “Only an idiot both votes to cut Medicaid and can’t spell it, @derrickvanorden. Please stop embarrassing Wisconsin.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Van Orden tenderized like prime Wisconsin beef, the table was set for the lawmakers&#8217; on-air airing of grievances.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I saw your drunken tweet at 1:30 in the morning last night,” Pocan told Van Orden, as Wied gingerly stepped away from the shot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“No, I got done with the NDAA, you jerk,” Van Orden responded, referring to the annual National Defense Authorization Act.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“You’ve got a problem,&#8221; Van Orden continued. &#8220;I don’t know what it is, but I’d encourage you to seek mental health counseling. It’s absolutely disgusting.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pocan lobbed back, “Why are you so afraid to debate anyone here? Why don’t you want to debate the &#8216;Big Beautiful Bill&#8217;? Why are you afraid?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Van Orden then accused Pocan of never holding a real job, claiming contrarily that the congressman “funnels over $500,000 a year of his campaign money to buy signs from his company.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The longtime business owner shot back. “I’ve owned a small business for 37 years,” Pocan said, referring to Budget Signs &amp; Specialties, a union print shop in Madison he cofounded in 1988. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Tony, you owned a small business,&#8221; he said to Wied, stationed safely behind the interviewer for the fight. &#8220;That’s a little work, isn’t it?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Look that up,&#8221; Pocan said, as Van Orden hurled false accusations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Oh, my God,” Pocan continued, laughing as the Republican wandered from the scene. “Are you drinking right now, Derrick? That’s the real question.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Van Orden has a longstanding reputation as a hot head.</p>\n\n\n\n  <div class=\" adb-ln-inarticle\">\n      </div>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2023, he made news when he excoriated Senate pages for taking a traditional photo lying on the mosaic floor of the Capitol Rotunda. He told the students, “Wake the f**k up you little shits!” and “Get the f**k out of here. You are defiling the space.” Pages reported him calling them “jackasses” and “lazy s**ts.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2021, Van Orden <a href=\"https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2021/08/librarian-says-gop-candidate-checked-nearly-pride-books-just-kids-couldnt/\">confronted a student librarian</a> in Wisconsin over a Pride Month book display, jabbing a finger at his victim and demanding to know who was responsible for setting it up so he could “teach them a lesson.”  </p>\n<p><em>Subscribe to the <a href=\"https://www.lgbtqnation.com/about-lgbtq/mail-list/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>LGBTQ Nation newsletter</strong></a> and be the first to know about the latest headlines shaping LGBTQ+ communities worldwide.</em></p>",

No matter how good the dad is, he can’t be everything. And then that boy may need somebody to give the boy some perspective on the dad.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The former president offered an example from his own life of a gay man who influenced him profoundly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I had a gay professor in college at a time when openly gay folks still weren’t out a lot, who became one of my favorite professors and was a great guy and would call me out when I started saying stuff that was ignorant,” Obama recalled. “You need that, to show empathy and kindness.”</p>\n\n\n\n  <div class=\" adb-ln-inarticle\">\n      </div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Obama has told a version of this story before. In his 2020 memoir, <em>A Promised Land</em>, the former president <a href=\"https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2020/11/barack-obama-admits-used-anti-gay-slurs-taking-office/\">admitted to throwing around anti-LGBTQ+ slurs</a> with his friends growing up in the 1970s, describing them as “callow attempts to fortify our masculinity and hide our insecurities.” But, he wrote, once he came to understand the discrimination LGBTQ+ people faced from out friends and professors in college, he “felt ashamed of my past behavior – and learned to do better.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The former president has specifically credited Dr. Lawrence Goldyn, who taught European Politics when Obama was a student at Occidental College, with reshaping his understanding of the LGBTQ+ community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“He was the first openly gay professor that I had ever come in contact with, or openly gay person of authority that I had come in contact with,” Obama recalled in a <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=KgB0pfSYbj8C&amp;pg=PA105&amp;lpg=PA105&amp;dq=%22he+was+a+wonderful+guy%22+obama+goldyn+advocate&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WiF_lkSVws&amp;sig=OtvsPPOd6jR7H2Y__uPAf9OybW0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ay2rT8L4H4KD6AHx5ojDAQ&amp;ved=0CG4Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22he%20was%20a%20wonderful%20guy%22%20obama%20goldyn%20advocate&amp;f=false\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">2008 interview</a> with <em>The Advocate</em>. “He wasn’t proselytizing all the time, but just his comfort in his own skin and the friendship we developed helped to educate me on a number of these issues.”</p>\n\n\n\n  <div class=\" adb-ln-inarticle\">\n      </div>\n\n\n\n<p>“He went out of his way to advise lesbian, gay, and transgender students at Occidental, and keep in mind, this was 1978,” Obama told <em><a href=\"https://www.out.com/out100-2015/2015/11/10/out100-president-barack-obama-ally-year\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Out</a></em> in 2015. “That took a lot of courage, a lot of confidence in who you are and what you stand for. I got to recognize Lawrence last year at our Pride Month reception at the White House, and thank him for influencing the way I think about so many of these issues.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On <em>IMO</em> this week, Obama went on to add that cis, straight parents should also try to cultivate friendships within their own circle of friends. “That if you then have a boy who is gay or nonbinary or whatever, they have somebody that they can go, ‘Okay, I&#8217;m not alone in this,’ right?” he explained.</p>\n<p><em>Subscribe to the <a href=\"https://www.lgbtqnation.com/about-lgbtq/mail-list/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>LGBTQ Nation newsletter</strong></a> and be the first to know about the latest headlines shaping LGBTQ+ communities worldwide.</em></p>",

Since its launch in 2022, its counselors have aided over 1.5 million callers.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>&#8220;People across the nation do not think of their LGBTQ children or parents or sisters or brothers or friends as political pawns, yet Trump does.&#8221;</p><cite>Rep. Andrea Salinas (D-OR)</cite></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s 1.5 million reasons why this program works,&#8221; Trevor Project CEO Jaymes Black said in the Thursday press conference, noting that the program provided &#8220;life-saving, evidence-based mental health crisis care &#8230; to  LGBTQ+ youth in every corner of the United States.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;When the legislation for this program was signed into law by President Trump during his first term, Democrats and Republicans came together with unity to address a public health crisis,&#8221; Black added, while Republican Rep. Mike Lawler of New York stood behind her. &#8220;They unified around the fundamental American principle, protecting our nation&#8217;s most vulnerable youth.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But now, Salinas says Trump has personally shut down the special LGBTQ+ youth services line &#8220;as red meat to his base.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;What Trump is doing is reprehensible. He is literally going to cause lives to be lost — it&#8217;s unthinkable,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I am sure that Republicans and unaffiliated voters and people across the nation do not think of their LGBTQ children or parents or sisters or brothers or friends as political pawns, yet Trump does.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n  <div class=\" adb-ln-inarticle\">\n      </div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;[Trump] believes he wins by bringing up culture war issues, and what he is doing like in so many other instances — whether it&#8217;s taking Medicaid away from people who need Medicaid for healthcare, or taking nutrition away from people who need food — he is taking away a helpline for people who are contemplating taking their own lives,&#8221; Salinas said. &#8220;These are people in real crisis.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though 988&#8217;s main line will continue to provide special services for Spanish speakers and veterans, Salinas said she worries for 988&#8217;s crisis support counselors who&#8217;ll now have to aid young distressed queer callers without having any specific training on how to do so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s so important that we have people who are trained specifically to help different individuals from different communities,&#8221; Salinas said. &#8220;If anyone has ever been in that situation, where someone has reached out to them for help, it is really scary to be the other person on the other end of the line if you are not trained and you don&#8217;t know anything else to do but to give love and support.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n  <div class=\" adb-ln-inarticle\">\n      </div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Salinas and her colleagues want to raise public awareness so that people tell their Congress members to fight back against the program&#8217;s cancellation. As legislators, they hold the budgetary &#8220;purse strings&#8221; and have a constitutional duty to negotiate appropriations funding packages to ensure taxpayer funds are allocated towards much-needed services, Salinas said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Toward this end, the Trevor Project has <a href=\"https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/protect-988-suicide-and-crisis-lifeline-for-lgbtq-youth/\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">begun a petition</a> — with over 52,000 co-signers as of Friday morning — asking the president and Congress members to restore the program&#8217;s funding. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, Salinas is asking people to share their stories with Congress members: personal stories about people who have needed mental health support — those who received help and those who couldn&#8217;t and didn&#8217;t know where else to turn. </p>\n\n\n\n  <div class=\" adb-ln-inarticle\">\n      </div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want people to think of members of Congress as shallow and heartless,&#8221; Salinas said. &#8220;I care. I really care. And my Republican colleagues, I know they care too. I know they have people in their community. And when you reach out and share these stories&#8230; it&#8217;s impactful.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Let your member of Congress know that this kind of funding is important, because it doesn&#8217;t take a lot in terms of the funding,&#8221; she said, noting that the Republican budget plan seeks to kick 17 million people off Medicaid to give &#8220;tax breaks to billionaires.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not expensive,&#8221; she reiterated. &#8220;The 988 system is already set up. It&#8217;s just one additional line, and it&#8217;s very affordable in terms of the return on investment, when you&#8217;re talking about saving lives.&#8221; Salinas promised she and her allies would not stop fighting until special services mental healthcare is accessible to all who need it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Editor’s note: This article mentions suicide.

Lambda Legal argued that the executive orders violate the plaintiffs&#8217; rights to equal protection, free speech, and due process, and that the orders likely violate the Separation of Powers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jose Abrigo, senior attorney and HIV Project director at Lambda Legal, confirmed on Tuesday that the funding cuts had been restored.</p>\n\n\n\n  <div class=\" adb-ln-inarticle\">\n      </div>\n\n\n\n<p>“We have confirmed that our plaintiffs – LGBTQ+ organizations providing critical services to their communities – have seen their threatened funding restored,” <a href=\"https://lambdalegal.org/newsroom/us_20250715_government-restores-millions-in-funding-to-lgbtq-hiv-orgs/#:~:text=Lambda%20Legal%20announced%20today%20that,including%20those%20living%20with%20HIV\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">he said in a statement</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Together, the groups provide a range of critical programs serving the LGBTQ+ community, including HIV treatment and prevention, sexual and reproductive health screenings and services, youth programs, homelessness prevention, and mental health and employment services, among others.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We know the battle is far from over and there will be setbacks along the way,&#8221; Abrigo added, &#8220;but the cause is too important, and the need too great, for us to lose heart.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n  <div class=\" adb-ln-inarticle\">\n      </div>\n\n\n\n<p>The win comes amid a mixed record of success clawing back cuts by the Trump administration to programs focused on the LGBTQ+ community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This week, under pressure from a coalition of Senate Democrats and Republicans, the Trump administration acceded to a demand to <a href=\"https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2025/07/white-house-backs-off-demand-for-cuts-to-global-hiv-aids-program-pepfar/\">restore over $400 million in cuts to PEPFAR</a>, the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. That program was thrown into chaos earlier this year as Elon Musk&#8217;s DOGE initiative gutted foreign aid with the dismantlement of the USAID. The Senate has until Friday to approve the revised funding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Launched in 2003 by President George W. Bush to fund HIV prevention, treatment, and care, the program has been one of the most successful global health initiatives, saving tens of millions of lives and helping to combat HIV/AIDS in low-income countries, especially in Africa and the Caribbean. Despite its success, the president and congressional Republicans have repeatedly targeted the program, with social conservatives claiming PEPFAR funds are used to promote LGBTQ+ rights.</p>\n\n  <div class=\" adb-ln-inarticle\">\n      </div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>At the Department of Health and Human Services, however, Democrats in Congress had no luck beating back the dismantlement of a service dedicated to LGBTQ+ youth.

Mark Pocan (D-WI). “This shortsighted and dangerous plan undermines 988’s ability to provide tailored support for a population with a higher risk of suicide and will have lethal consequences if enacted.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since it began operation with the support of the Trevor Project in 2022, the &#8220;Press 3 option&#8221; has helped support an increasing number of LGBTQ+ youth, with demand growing from 1,752 referrals in September 2022 to 58,924 in February 2025 alone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Calls reached their peak in January with Trump’s inauguration. 60,711 callers that month shared their distress with Lifeline counselors.</p>\n<p><em>Subscribe to the <a href=\"https://www.lgbtqnation.com/about-lgbtq/mail-list/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>LGBTQ Nation newsletter</strong></a> and be the first to know about the latest headlines shaping LGBTQ+ communities worldwide.</em></p><div class=\"outstream-ad-holder\"><div class=\"adb-oplayer\" id=\"div-gpt-ad-outstreamplayer\"></div></div>",

Enacted by former President Barack Obama in 2012, the program allowed some people who came to the United States as minors without documentation to apply for a renewable two-year period of deferred action from deportation, granting them a Social Security number and work authorization.</p>\n\n\n  <blockquote>\n    <h3>Never Miss a Beat</h3>\n    <p>\n      Subscribe to our newsletter to stay ahead of the latest LGBTQ+ political news and insights.<br />\n      <a href=\"https://www.lgbtqnation.com/newsletter/\"><strong>Subscribe to our Newsletter today</strong></a>\n    </p>\n  </blockquote>\n\n<p>The policy has been tied up in court since 2017, when the first Trump administration announced its intention to repeal it. Former President Joe Biden signed a 2021 executive order reinstating the program, but the following July, a federal judge ruled that DACA was “created in violation of the law” and “illegally implemented” because Obama had bypassed Congress by creating it via an executive branch memorandum. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the ruling allowed for “Dreamers” — those already protected by the program — to retain their protected status and for renewals to proceed.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not citizens,” Xunami explained on <em>Drag Race </em>in 2024. “We&#8217;re kind of in limbo. We&#8217;re legally here because we were already here, but we don&#8217;t have the full rights of a citizen.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Xunami did not directly cite the current administration’s ongoing brutal crackdown on undocumented immigrants, she did note that she will be joining fellow <em>Drag Race</em> stars Aja, Kandy Muse, and Dahlia Sin on a 10-city <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DKeVIzVul-T/\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">European tour</a> next month, followed by a tour of Australia in November. To travel outside the U.S. and return legally, DACA recipients must apply for Advance Parole.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amid the administration’s mass deportations and ICE raids, at least one fan on social media likened Xunami’s decision to “self-deportation.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“DACA queens are self-deporting now,” X user @CTprogressive_ wrote. “I hate how this country treats immigrants. She deserved better.”</p>\n\n\n\n  <div class=\" adb-ln-inarticle\">\n      </div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">DACA queens are self-deporting now <img alt=\"💔\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f494.png\" style=\"height: 1em;\" /> I hate how this country treats immigrants.

    "title": "Trans people need to be terrified",
    "content": "<p>Donald Trump has held the presidency for less than six months in 2025. But already, trans people have been defaced, demoralized, and fatigued. On June 18, the Supreme Court upheld a ban on gender affirming care for trans youth in nearly half of U.S. states. This ensures that trans youth do not have access to hormone blockers that prevent them from becoming their hated gender.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Trump administration has also ensured that Medicaid can no longer provide subsidized and insurance-covered care to trans adults. In addition to this, Trump’s White House has banned trans people from the military and has stripped all government agencies and universities of having Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) departments. Even progressive minded institutions like Yale (my alma mater) and Harvard have stripped themselves of DEI. Trump’s cruelty knows no bounds.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This month, former president Obama stated over Instagram that Trump’s administration was becoming more and more like an autocracy. Recently, a tourist was stripped of his U.S. visa when federal agents discovered a JD Vance meme on his phone.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ICE is raiding more and more immigrant families–immigrants who provide critical labor to our U.S. fields and other important industries. Immigrant children are forced to stand testimony and defend themselves–without a lawyer–in court. The United States, in other words, is becoming more and more like a fascist state. Look no further than Trump’s removal of the Kennedy Center board, and his ban of a Pride event at the Kennedy Center. During his campaign years, Trump held queer events for “LGB” folk — but made sure to drop the “T”, because it is becoming all too apparent that he is cruel to trans people.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a past article I wrote for the Blade, I stated that not <a href=\"https://www.washingtonblade.com/2025/03/26/opinion-arlington-trans-sanctuary-city/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">enough trans people are scared</a> in the U.S. right now. Other countries, including European countries, are quickly warning their trans citizens against traveling to the U.S., citing the fact that we are a hostile place for folks like them. Unfortunately, this is true. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trans people have to start looking to move to sanctuary states right now. In fact, we have already been doing this for many years: trans citizens have been fleeing red, conservative states–states where men shoot trans women (and trans men). But now is the time to do so more than ever. Check out outcoast.com for a useful list of some sanctuary cities for trans people in the U.S. right now. But other cities not on the list, including my college town of New Haven, Connecticut, are also welcoming places for trans people.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Transgender Americans have to take into consideration the fact that Trump and his cronies have sought to overthrow us in just less than six months’ time. They are trying to make us weak, vulnerable, up for the taking. Yet we have to stand strong amid all the attacks from Republican lawmakers. One has to question the fact that ICE is starting to use social media to go after any naysayer — and deliberate whether ICE will be going after trans Americans in two or three years to come. If Trump is doing so much damage to the trans community already, what will be happening in 2028? A move to Canada can surely be on the horizon.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Transgender Americans need to be scared right now. But more than just scared, we need to be taking action.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br /><em><strong>Isaac Amend</strong> is a writer based in the D.C. area.

    "title": "Rise in sex parties in Brazil upends country’s gay nightlife",
    "content": "<p>Gay nightlife in Brazil, especially in Rio de Janeiro and other cities with great tourist, is going through a difficult time. If in the past there were countless LGBTQ nightclubs scattered around the city, with the vast majority of them in Copacabana, today there are no more than six in the area. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The emergence of the internet and later dating apps made it possible to meet someone through a small screen without having to go to a nightclub. But it wasn&#8217;t just the digital world that had an influence on this; several other issues also contributed to the decline of Brazilian gay nightlife. To better understand this new scenario, the Washington Blade spoke to veteran artists from Brazil’s LGBTQ scene to understand the roots of this complex enigma.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cost of maintaining a nightclub involves high and fixed expenses, such as rent, staff for various functions, attractions, and other bills, when financial return was guaranteed in the past, but not today. Brazil&#8217;s gay nightlife, especially in Rio, hasn&#8217;t gone extinct, it&#8217;s still resisting, but competing with new trends: sex parties. In recent years, they have become more and more frequent in the “Cidade Maravilhosa” or the “Marvelous City” as Rio is known and their main focus is group sex.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spread between the city’s South and Central Zones, they take place on regular dates, in fixed or itinerant locations, such as saunas and old mansions. They are always on a differentiated schedule that can involve go-go boys, open bars, and other attractions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s impossible to talk about the success of these spicy parties without having a look at gay nightlife in the past; and the changes that took place during the 1990s and 2000s, when the internet was just becoming popular and a new generation was being born. If in the past, gay nightclubs were a place to dance, drink, flirt, and maybe end the night with someone, these stages have been skipped for something much more immediate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/machomanclub/\">MachoMan</a>, one of Rio’s most famous sex parties, brings together a male audience of around 130 participants at each edition. The event has grown and is currently held in three different places: a mansion, a sauna, and a bar. Over the seven years of its existence, the party&#8217;s creator, Maurício Code, estimates that 25,000 men have been there. Asked about the popularity of adult parties in parallel with the decline of nightclubs, he replied: &#8220;In times of immediacy when it comes to libido, many people want to skip the flirting phase and get straight to the point. Less talk and more action is the premise of the new times.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the organizer, there are guarantees at a carnal party, which can be uncertain at a nightclub.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“At sex parties, the guarantee of some sexual interaction is a certainty,” he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MachoMan has had upwards of 220 parties. Some of them offer an open bar, changing rooms, showers, a steam room, and even places for BDSM and other fetishes. Unlike the nightclubs that had darkrooms for anonymous pleasure in the dark, the pleasure at these parties is collective and in front of everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-98972031\" height=\"1502\" src=\"https://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2025/07/MachoMan_party_poster_insert_courtesy_MachoMan.jpg\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>A flyer for a MachoMan party (Photo courtesy of MachoMan)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another issue to be considered is that the cost of these sex parties is lower than that of nightclubs; since the events take place on specific dates, the professionals involved (bartenders, DJs, cleaners, go-go boys, bodyguards, etc.) are hired just for that occasion. The rented space can host other events — straight or gay — on other dates — with our without erotic appeal. Because they don&#8217;t take place on specific days, this also creates an expectation among the audience for the next party..</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, the only obstacle to these libidinous parties is competition.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are currently dozens taking place almost simultaneously in Rio and other cities. The schedule varies little, but they always have beautiful naked men with bodies sculpted in the gym entering a male audience eager for pleasure. Raphael Habbib is one of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although he is Brazilian, he has Arab features and is one of the most sought-after go-go boys, appearing at many libertine parties with his sensual performances. For him, the phenomenon of erotic parties is associated with a change in behavior.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The gay audience has changed, we are now more willing to experience sexuality in a more genuine way, exploring all forms of enjoyment,” said Habbib.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regarding the collapse of nightclubs, he reflects: “Sex parties have a nightclub atmosphere, music, booze, and lots of sex with no compromise, in other words, they have everything that nightclubs used to have and more.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-98972030\" height=\"1800\" src=\"https://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2025/07/Brazil_men_making_out_insert_courtesy_Raphael_Habbib.jpg\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>(Photo courtesy of Raphael Habbib)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-portrait-of-the-past-gay-scene\">A portrait of the past gay scene</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the 1980s and 1990s in Brazil; nightlife was a meeting of tribes, of subcultures, each occupying their own space and, above all, expressing their sexuality after a full day of repression at work. In this sense, nightlife was a place to let loose, enjoy, drink, and interact, even if the hangover came the next day. The big urban centers had endless nights, streets full until dawn, and pleasant encounters came about by chance. There has been a transformation that not only involves the rise of the internet, but also economic crisis and violence. Nightlife is quieter, and there is no single culprit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, since the 2000s, the LGBTQ nightlife scene has been changing by leaps and bounds. Nightlife entrepreneurs have had to reinvent themselves as their audiences have migrated elsewhere; and some, even though they were looking for innovation, ended up closing their doors a few years later.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Veteran drag queen Eula Rochard has been on stage since 1984 and has followed all these changes closely. For her, the advance of LGBTQ policies in Brazil since the late 1990s has caused the gay community to spread to other places where they were not welcome before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While in terms of rights it was progress, on the other hand, there was a move away from gay &#8220;ghettos.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;People who used to hide from home to go to nightclubs no longer hide,” said Rochard. “In the 1980s, everything was hidden, the nightclubs were ghettos, there were several at the time, the fees were bad, but there was a lot of work. I traveled the country.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rochard, however, recognizes the importance of these policies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“That was great, because in my time people were killed and nothing happened (impunity), but businessmen no longer wanted to invest in nightclubs, if a gay person could go or kiss anywhere, so the nightlife for us gays has weakened a lot, it&#8217;s almost non-existent,” she said.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-98972032\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2025/07/Eula_Richard_insert_courtesy_Eula_Richard.jpg\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em><strong>Eula Richard</strong> (Photo courtesy of Eula Richard)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Rochard in 2023 made international headlines when she revealed that former U.S. Rep. George Santos (R-N.Y.) was once a drag queen known as Kitara Ravache who performed in Rio and in the nearby city of Niterói,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trans artist Angelika Rawaxi shares the same opinion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Nowadays we have the chance to go to other places, we have laws in our favor, and we don&#8217;t have to be in ghettos anymore,” said Rawaxi. “What has contributed is the freedom we&#8217;ve been given to go to other places and expand our work.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both don&#8217;t believe that the internet has harmed gay nightlife, on the contrary. In terms of relationships, however, the online world has presented a problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;People used to go to gay clubs to kiss, to find a boyfriend, and that&#8217;s over,” lamented Rawaxi. “Today gay people go to dating apps, no one meets by looking, by touching, by dancing to a song like they used to.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-98972029\" height=\"798\" src=\"https://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2025/07/Angelika_Rawaxi_insert_courtesy_Angelika_Rawaxi.jpg\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em><strong>Angelika Rawaxi</strong> (Photo courtesy of Angelika Rawaxi)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The now-closed Le Boy was Rio&#8217;s most popular gay nightclub.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 1970s inspired its decor, with mirrored globes, sofas, and a Studio 54 vibe. Calvin Klein, Jean-Paul Gaultier, Rupert Everett, Rihanna, and Katy Perry are among the celebrities who were seen at Le Boy. It remained open from 1992-2016, but succumbed to the economic crisis and its French owner put the property up for sale after 24 years. Another gay nightclub opened in the same place in 2024, and it is one of the few remaining in Copacabana.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the LGBTQ establishments closed their doors, the drag queens and crossdressers who used to perform on stage had to look for other ways.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Businessman Júnior Barbosa, owner of Rio&#8217;s most notorious gay sauna, was a pioneer when he hired these artists to perform at his establishment in Copacabana. The initiative represented a new field of work for those who depended on LGBTQ nightclubs. Others, like drag queen Gabrielly Rodin, were able to reinvent themselves and migrated to straight parties and other events.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I went to other venues, and I always had acceptance and financial return,” Rodin told the Blade.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rodin attributes the decline of LGBTQ nightlife to the replacement of drag queens by DJs, and to the open bar that devalued the artists, as if the crowd were more interested in drinking than enjoying a performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-lgbtq-nightlife-decline-is-not-unique-to-brazil\">LGBTQ nightlife decline is not unique to Brazil</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Germany since the 1990s has seen the same transition as Brazil.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Clubsterben” is a German expression that means “death of nightclub culture,” especially in Berlin, a previous oasis of the techno scene.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Wilde Renate, a nightclub in a poorly maintained building, will close at the end of the year, while the Watergate closed its doors at the end of 2024 after 22 years. A <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250113-is-berlins-famous-club-scene-ending\">report </a>carried out in November by an organization representing Berlin&#8217;s clubs revealed that half of the 250 or so nightclubs in the German capital are at risk of closing their doors this year. Berlin&#8217;s nightlife is not at its best, and the rest of the world in general. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-98972033\" height=\"799\" src=\"https://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2025/07/20240400_Schwuz_club_in_Berlin_insert_c_Washington_Blade_by_Michael_K_Lavers.jpg\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Schwuz, a gay club in a former brewery in Berlin, in April 2024.

Therefore, the death of the Berlin or Rio nightclubs is not an isolated situation, but a reality in the ever-changing world, as well as a generational change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Against the backdrop of the Brazilian crisis, La Cueva nightclub is an exception. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has been in business since 1964 and is Latin America’s oldest gay club. The underground nightclub in Copacabana has withstood the dictatorship of the 1960s and 1970s, the AIDS epidemic of the 1980s, the economic crises of the 1990s. Its longevity may be associated with its strictly mature audience (on average over 55) who still prefer eye-to-eye contact and dancing to flashbacks, and are probably not so adept at virtual media.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-98972028\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2025/07/La_Cueva_in_Brazil_insert_c_Washington_Blade_by_Michael_K_Lavers.jpg\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>La Cueva opened in 1964 (Washington Blade photo by Michael K.

Interaction between people seems to have lost a bit of its meaning. They’re not disconnected from the virtual world, even when they are with friends in bars.

Conservatives in the Senate tend to support international aid generally and global HIV initiatives specifically, while the House GOP caucus includes a group of hardline budget hawks who pushed hard for more cuts to offset the cost of the bill, which is nevertheless projected to add more than $3 trillion to the deficit. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The so-called &#8220;Big Beautiful Bill&#8221; extends and builds upon tax cuts passed in 2017 that disproportionately benefit the wealthy, beefing up budgets for immigration enforcement and defense while cutting federal spending nearly everywhere else, especially on Medicaid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As many as 10 million people are expected to lose their health care coverage, a disproportionate number of them LGBTQ.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notwithstanding his position on the Senate Republicans&#8217; amendment to save PEPFAR, Trump at the start of his second term froze funding for nearly all foreign aid programs, including HIV prevention and treatment initiatives overseas, leading to shortages of medicine and care. </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.washingtonblade.com/2025/07/18/future-of-pepfar-in-limbo-as-negotiations-over-trumps-signature-spending-bill-continue/\">Future of PEPFAR in limbo as negotiations over Trump&#8217;s signature spending bill continue</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.washingtonblade.com\">Washington Blade: LGBTQ News, Politics, LGBTQ Rights, Gay News</a>.</p>",

    "title": "Garcia writes to HHS Secretary about the dismantling of HIV programs in Trump’s second term",
    "content": "<p>U.S. Rep. Robert Garcia (D-Calif.), ranking member of the House Oversight Committee, sent a letter on Thursday to U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. demanding answers about the Trump-Vance administration&#8217;s &#8220;systematic&#8221; elimination of programs to fight HIV in the U.S. and around the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also signed by Democratic Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois, the <a href=\"https://oversightdemocrats.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/democrats-oversight.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2025-07-17.garcia-krishnamoorthi-to-hhs-rfk-jr-re-trump-hiv-funding-cuts.pdf\">letter</a> requests information about cuts to federal support for HIV research, including vaccine development efforts, the shuttering of the HIV prevention division of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the defunding of programs providing HIV treatment and prevention services since President Donald Trump returned to the White House.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lawmakers requested responses by or before the end of July. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It is shameful that HHS Secretary RFK Jr. and the Trump Administration are working to dismantle our HIV research, care, and prevention programs aimed at eradicating the disease across the world,&#8221; Garcia said. &#8220;This decision is absolutely reckless and puts millions of lives at risk.  Oversight Democrats refuse to let Secretary Kennedy’s reliance on conspiracy theories and misinformation threaten the health and safety of our public health.&#8221;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The Trump Administration’s reckless decision to gut HIV prevention and research programs is not only scientifically indefensible—it’s morally unconscionable. These cuts jeopardize the health of millions, both at home and abroad, and reverse decades of bipartisan progress in the fight against HIV/AIDS,&#8221; Krishnamoorthi said. &#8220;We’re demanding answers because the American people, and the global community, deserve better than politically motivated neglect of public health.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Echoing warnings from HIV and public health experts, the congressmen in their letter stressed that backsliding in efforts to fight the disease at home and abroad come just as advancements in treatment and prevention have finally put some of the most ambitious goals to end the epidemic within reach. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The letter suggests that Kennedy&#8217;s embrace of misinformation about HIV might explain, to some extent, his dismantling of programs to end the epidemic at home and abroad, specifically, pointing to the secretary&#8217;s history of challenging the overwhelming and longstanding scientific and medical consensus about the causal relationship between HIV and AIDS. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The congressmen also detailed many of the real-world consequences of health policy concerning HIV in Trump&#8217;s second term. For example, they note experts anticipate there will be millions of excess new HIV infections and hundreds of thousands of excess HIV-related deaths in Sub-Saharan Africa in just one year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The letter also warns that &#8220;President Trump’s Fiscal Year 2026 budget request for domestic HIV program calls for a $1.5 billion reduction in funding,&#8221; which &#8220;could lead to more than 143,000 additional HIV cases in the United States within five years and about 127,000 additional deaths from HIV and AIDS-related causes.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-garcia-s-leadership-of-oversight-dems-will-be-closely-watched\">Garcia&#8217;s leadership of Oversight Dems will be closely watched </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If Democrats recapture a majority of seats in the House next year, Garcia becomes chair of the committee and has access to far more powerful tools to exercise oversight — like the authority to issue subpoenas (unilaterally or by majority vote) compelling witnesses to testify or requiring officials to turn over documents. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leadership positions, especially coveted spots leading the most powerful committees in Congress, are typically awarded based on seniority. When the House Democratic caucus elected Garcia on June 24, it marked the first first time in more than a century that a second-term member was selected for the role. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>During his brief time in Washington, the congressman, who is openly gay and formerly served as mayor of Long Beach, has emerged as arguably one of the strongest communicators in the House Democratic caucus and one of his party&#8217;s most vocal critics of the second Trump administration.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thursday&#8217;s letter, which comes less than a month after his election as ranking member, may signal how Garcia will approach fact finding missions and investigations, or where he will focus the committee&#8217;s work, under the vastly expanded powers that might be available to him after the midterms.  </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.washingtonblade.com/2025/07/17/garcia-writes-to-hhs-secretary-about-the-dismantling-of-hiv-programs-in-trumps-second-term/\">Garcia writes to HHS Secretary about the dismantling of HIV programs in Trump&#8217;s second term</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.washingtonblade.com\">Washington Blade: LGBTQ News, Politics, LGBTQ Rights, Gay News</a>.</p>",

She continued her education at Georgetown University, earning a Master’s degree in International Development Policy, preparing herself to make the meaningful impact she so deeply desired.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her academic achievements were just the beginning of a life devoted to serving people across cultures.

She spent her final years as a MEL Technical Advisor for The Palladium Group in Washington, D.C., where she helped evaluate and improve USAID projects worldwide. She was passionate about ensuring that development programs truly served the communities they were designed to help, always asking the hard questions about effectiveness and impact.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cassandra’s commitment to community extended beyond her personal circles. For many years, she volunteered at the Rainbow History Project in DC, where she collected oral histories from her queer elders.

After playing golf for his high school team, he transitioned to focusing on the business of the sport, attending the University of Maryland Eastern Shore and joining the <a href=\"https://wwwcp.umes.edu/pga/\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">PGA Golf Management</a> program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It teaches you how to be a golf pro,&#8221; he said of the program. &#8220;Running your day-to-day golf course. Typically it teaches you the program side. At my school it taught me the hospitality side of the industry.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His career has brought him to Golf Digest, Golf Channel, Belle Haven Country Club in Virginia, Peninsula Golf &amp; Country Club in Delaware and scores of other places.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His passion for the sport stems from a golf course&#8217;s ability to bring people together, four by four.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It is a connecting sport. It’s one of the few places you can be with a group of people &#8212; at a <a href=\"https://topgolf.com/us/\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Top Golf</a> setting or a traditional golf course &#8212; for four hours and really meet the person and hear what drew them to picking up a golf club.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n  <div class=\" adb-os-inarticle\">\n      </div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>To be sure, Frazier loves just playing the game itself as well. There are so many ways to complete a golf course, and every time he approaches a course is different. A shot goes here, a putt goes there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“You have 18 holes nad 14 clubs and everyone trying to get the ball into the hole as fast as possible. It brings out the best of people. You get your highs, your lows, your problem solving. And you get some great memories out of it.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding to Frazier’s great memories of the game is now the <a href=\"https://www.outsports.com/2025/6/12/24113421/world-pride-capital-cup-washington-dc-gay-lgbtq-athletes/\">World Pride Capital Cup</a>, held last month in Washington, D.C., and which partnered with the LPGA and USGA.

Living in College Park, Md., just outside of Washington, Frazier has found the local <a href=\"https://lambdalinks.com/\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Lambda Links</a> group &#8212; an LGBTQ golf organization designed to bring the community together around the sport.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“And at the national level too, working with the PGA of America,” he said. Frazier is involved in the PGA of America Pride resource group, <a href=\"https://www.pgareach.org/pgaworks\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">PGA WORKS</a> and other inclusion pieces in the Association.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, Frazier is a golf nut at heart, thankful to be working a career in the sport he loves and able to tell stories about the people in and around golf.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While he works to make the sport as inclusive as possible, Frazier said being LGBTQ “doesn’t affect my work. But does it enhance my work? Yes. It’s not a defining factor, but being a teacher and helping produce stories about golf in general, the importance of highlighting different parts of the community, definitely gives me a different lens to tell stories.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Subscribe to the <a href=\"https://www.outsports.com/newsletter/\"><em><strong>Outsports</strong></em> <strong>newsletter</strong></a> to keep up with your favorite out athletes, inspiring LGBTQ sports stories, and more.</p><div class=\"outstream-ad-holder\"><div class=\"adb-oplayer\" id=\"div-gpt-ad-outstreamplayer\"></div></div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.outsports.com/2025/7/18/24115635/langston-frazier-pga-tour-radio-america-gay-golf/\">Out golf professional tells the stories of golf at PGA Tour Radio</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.outsports.com\">Outsports</a>.</p>",

Male athletes seem to be totally out or not, while many queer women occupy a space where they can be out without having to announce it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the top pick in the recent WNBA draft, Bueckers is a major star, and Fudd was part of a championship-winning UConn team, so their relationship is getting attention. But it&#8217;s not nearly the amount had a top NBA player been open about a relationship with a man. It&#8217;s why in compiling <a href=\"https://www.outsports.com/2024/8/13/24098536/2024-summer-olympics-paris-record-lgbtq-out-athletes/\">our list of out LGBTQ Olympians</a> in Paris, we combed through social media accounts of athletes and found a slew of women living openly on social media and no men.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s great that Bueckers and Fudd have found each other and that they are allowed to share as much of it they want with the public. It is progress.</p>\n<p>Subscribe to the <a href=\"https://www.outsports.com/newsletter/\"><em><strong>Outsports</strong></em> <strong>newsletter</strong></a> to keep up with your favorite out athletes, inspiring LGBTQ sports stories, and more.</p><div class=\"outstream-ad-holder\"><div class=\"adb-oplayer\" id=\"div-gpt-ad-outstreamplayer\"></div></div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.outsports.com/2025/7/17/24115620/paige-bueckers-azzi-fudd-girlfriends-espys-photo/\">Paige Bueckers goes gaga over red carpet photos of Azzi Fudd as relationship grows more public</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.outsports.com\">Outsports</a>.</p>",

    "content": "More than $6 million in federal funding for nine non-profit organizations serving LGBTQ people and individuals living with HIV — including New York's LGBT Community center — has been reinstated for now after <a href=\"https://gaycitynews.com/lgbtq-centers-trump-sue-executive-orders/\">Lambda Legal spearheaded a lawsuit</a> targeting three of the president's executive orders.\n\nThe case of San Francisco AIDS Foundation v. Trump originated in February when the nine organizations, represented by Lambda Legal, filed the federal lawsuit challenging three executive orders signed early in President Donald Trump's term: “Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government,” “Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing,” and “Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity.”\n\nIn early June, the US District Court for the Northern District of California <a href=\"https://gaycitynews.com/federal-court-blocks-trump-anti-trans-orders/\">granted a preliminary injunction</a> against several provisions of the three executive orders.\n\nFollowing the executive orders, federal agencies told non-profits that funding would be cut at organizations serving transgender individuals or carrying out \"equity-related\" work, Lambda Legal said when the lawsuit was first filed.\n\nLambda Legal announced on July 15 that the $6.2 million in funding had been restored. Now, the organizations involved in the suit — including New York's LGBT Center — will be able to continue operating with the federal funds. Other organizations involved in the suit include the Bradbury-Sullivan Community Center in Pennsylvania, Baltimore Safe Haven in Maryland, FORGE in Wisconsin, and Prisma Community Care in Arizona.\n\nThe victory is only temporary as the case continues to proceed. But Lambda Legal is, at least for now, welcoming the restoration of funds.\n\n“We have confirmed that our plaintiffs — LGBTQ+ organizations providing critical services to their communities — have seen their threatened funding restored,” Jose Abrigo, senior attorney and HIV Project director at Lambda Legal, said in a written statement. “When we fight, we win. We know the battle is far from over and there will be setbacks along the way, but the cause is too important, and the need too great, for us to lose heart.”\n\nThe initial lawsuit was filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of California and argued that the executive orders violate free speech under the First Amendment as well as the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause and the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. The suit further accused the Trump administration of violating the Administrative Procedures Act.",

    "content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Puerto Rico Gov. Jenniffer González-Colón signed legislation on July 16 barring puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and gender-affirming surgeries for individuals younger the 21 years of age. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The law's text justifies the move by making the case that minors \"are particularly vulnerable to making decisions that can have irreversible consequences.\" The law further stipulates that public funds cannot be used for gender-affirming care for youth. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">González-Colón, a Republican who just took office this year, signed the legislation despite previously seeking amendments to safeguard access to puberty blockers and allow individuals already receiving gender-affirming care to continue to do so, according to the <a href=\"https://www.advocate.com/news/gender-affirming-care-puerto-rico\">Advocate</a>. However, lawmakers were not open to those changes.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The law carries sentences of 15 years in prison and $50,00 penalties, as well as the disqualification of medical licenses and permits, according to the Associated Press.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several groups, including the College of Physicians and Surgeons, the Association of Psychology, and the Puerto Rican Association of Professional Counseling, pushed unsuccessfully for the bill to be vetoed.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Waves Ahead Puerto Rico, an organization serving LGBTQ people on the island, described the governor as \"vicious\" for signing the bill into law.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"To our trans community after the governor’s vicious decision to make Senate Bill 350 into law, we remind you that we are here and we are not leaving,” the organization wrote on Facebook. “We have mental health services available to those who need it. Just as we do, we will fight alongside you, as always. We have each other.”</span>\n\nCurrently, 25 states ban best practice medication and surgical care for trans youth, while 14 states and the nation's capital have \"shield\" laws protecting access to trans care, according to Movement Advancement Project. Even before Puerto Rico imposed the new restrictions, 37% of trans youth between the ages of 13 and 17 lived in states with bans on gender-affirming care for youth.",
