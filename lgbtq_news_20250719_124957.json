Behind them at any one time you might see the flips, kicks and high heel clicks of bedazzled drag queens Nastia and Serenity. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could see the swishing of a burlesque fan held by co-founder Mark Winmill. Or, in the case of acrobatic clown Rowan, you might just see some penis. If you‚Äôre lucky enough to be perched in the front row, you may even find yourself drinking a cocktail through a straw that‚Äôs lodged through a pair of nostrils. Don‚Äôt ask us to explain, it all makes sense when it‚Äôs in front of you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is racy, risqu√© performance art, but it‚Äôs also just that: art. The level of skill, thought and intelligence in each routine radiates off each performer, and you‚Äôre left both completely in awe, eyes popped, and extremely ‚Äì as Fez‚Äôs catchphrase would put it ‚Äì <em>jealousssss</em> of their talent.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\"><div style=\"padding: 16px;\"> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DL-Dtd_qNWE/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\"line-height: 0; padding: 0 0; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; width: 100%;\" target=\"_blank\"> <div style=\"display: flex;\"> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"></div> <div style=\"display: flex;\"> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"></div> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"></div></div></div><div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"></div> <div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"></div><div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\"> <div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram</div></div><div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"></div> <div style=\"display: flex; margin-bottom: 14px;\"><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\"> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"></div> <div></div></div><div style=\"margin-left: auto;\"> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div> <div style=\"display: flex; margin-bottom: 24px;\"> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;\"></div> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; width: 144px;\"></div></div></a><p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; white-space: nowrap;\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DL-Dtd_qNWE/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\" target=\"_blank\">A post shared by HERE at Outernet (@hereldn)</a></p></div></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At one point, Fez notes that the group have failed to secure government funding back home in Australia as they aren‚Äôt seen as having &#8220;artistic merit&#8221;.

A &#8220;top&#8221; refers to an individual penetrating a person or people, while a &#8220;bottom&#8221; refers to a person being penetrated.

The site, launched in 2014, relies on users to update and verify the status of LGBTQ+ laws in countries across the globe, ranking them in a global equality index.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The entry featured in the viral post was submitted on 16 September 2013 during the site&#8217;s closed-alpha testing phase, using a 2009 Turkish progress report from the Commission of the European Communities as its source.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The report references the Turkish armed forces&#8217; homophobic policy which deems homosexuality a &#8220;psychosexual illness&#8221; and forbids out LGBTQ+ individuals from serving, adding that conscripts who do not want to serve in the army and instead declare their homosexuality in a bid to excuse themselves &#8220;have to provide photographic proof&#8221; and, in some cases, must &#8220;undergo humiliating medical examinations.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It does not, however, say that Turkiye military personnel must be exclusively tops to be eligible to serve in the armed forces.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Soldiers from the Turkish military marching in unison. \" class=\"wp-image-868345\" height=\"616\" src=\"https://www.thepinknews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Turkish-military-tops.jpg?w=1024\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Soldiers from the Turkish military marching in unison.

While Turkiye citizens must provide photographic proof of their homosexuality to be exempt from military service, it is not required that the photograph involve anal intercourse in any way. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17474967\">The BBC</a> reported in 2012 that a young man was banned from serving in the armed forces after showing a photograph of himself kissing another man.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.thepinknews.com/2025/07/18/turkish-military-tops-debunking-article/\">Viral tweet claims gay men can serve in the Turkish military ‚Äì but only if they&#8217;re a top</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.thepinknews.com\">PinkNews | Latest lesbian, gay, bi and trans news | LGBTQ+ news</a>.</p>",

We can&#8217;t know what was really going on for people who might, in a different time, have identified as queer or trans had the language been available to them, and speculating about the queer identities of icons of the past can be limiting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, the old quote attributed to Maya Angelou is also important to consider: when people tell you who they are, believe them. We might not know for sure if certain<a href=\"https://www.queerty.com/was-greta-garbo-trans-20250709/\"> figures from the past were trans</a>, but by looking at the things they left behind‚Äîtheir words, art, and opinions‚Äîwe can often see something of ourselves in them. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Someone who has been the subject of wide speculation in recent years is the Nirvana singer and grunge legend Kurt Cobain, and there are many reasons why. In the recent past, when Twitter/X was still a useable platform where queer people wanted to hang out, writer <a href=\"https://www.intomore.com/the-internet/kurt-cobain-trans-debate-rages/\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Magdalene Visaggio laid out the proof</a> in a series of posts that are, sadly, long gone. But the proof itself remains, and we&#8217;re here to lay out the lore. </p>\n\n\n\n  <blockquote>\n    <h3>How about we take this to the next level?</h3>\n    <p>\n      Subscribe to our newsletter for a refreshing cocktail (or mocktail) of LGBTQ+ entertainment and pop culture, served up with a side of eye-candy.<br />\n      <a href=\"https://www.queerty.com/newsletter/\"><strong>Subscribe to our Newsletter today</strong></a>\n    </p>\n  </blockquote>\n\n<p>There&#8217;s plenty of information out there to suggest that Cobain might have been bisexual: he said as much to a Monk Magazine interviewer <a href=\"https://www.advocate.com/arts-entertainment/people/2013/10/24/rediscovered-interview-reveals-kurt-cobain-thought-he-was-gay\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">in 1992</a>. &#8220;If I wouldn&#8217;t have found Courtney, I probably would have carried on with a bisexual lifestyle,&#8221; he explained, saying in other interviews that his homophobic mother didn&#8217;t allow him to have gay friends. </p>\n\n\n\n  <div class=\" adb-inarticle\">\n      </div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But gayness is one thing, and transness is entirely another.

He described the themes of 1993&#8217;s groundbreaking<em> In Utero</em> to his biographer as ‚Äúsex and woman&#8230;and vaginas and birth and death,&#8221; things men can and do write about, but not with such a personal stake as Cobain seems to have had. <em>‚Äú</em>Throughout my life, I‚Äôve always been really close with girls and made friends with girls,&#8221; Cobain told <a href=\"https://www.out.com/entertainment/popnography/2013/10/25/quote-day-kurt-cobain-thought-he-was-gay\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Advocate</em> in a 1993 interview</a>. &#8220;And I‚Äôve always been a really sickly, feminine person anyhow, so I thought I was gay for a while because I didn‚Äôt find any of the girls in my high school attractive at all.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n  <div class=\" adb-inarticle\">\n      </div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Cobain was a vocal advocate for LGBTQ+ rights his entire life and brushed shoulders with plenty out gay contemporaries, even telling homophobic Nirvana fans to <a href=\"https://www.nme.com/news/music/kurt-cobain-made-a-huge-difference-to-how-the-lgbtq-community-was-perceived-says-writer-of-new-play-3556170\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">stop supporting the band </a>if they held those views. In 1993, Cobain played a gig at Augusta Street, a well known trans hangout in Brazil. He wore a dress (and breasts) for the performance, while drummer Dave Grohl rocks a black bra. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n  <div class=\" adb-inarticle\">\n      </div>\n\n\n\n<p>All of which could be interpreted as simply punk as f*ck. And sure, it is that. Plenty of rockers like Alice Cooper and David Bowie played with gender identity and enjoyed a more genderfluid presentation. But few of them spoke often about the desire to<a href=\"https://medium.com/@dr.ow.sy/reclaiming-the-past-was-kurt-cobain-trans-6386d3e20bad\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> give birth, lactate</a>, and distance themselves completely from male identity and masculinity. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Obviously, we don&#8217;t know how Cobain might have identified in a different time. But one thing about trans folks is that we&#8217;re pretty good at spotting our own, even (perhaps especially) with those who came before us. </p>\n\n\n\n  <div class=\" adb-inarticle\">\n      </div>\n\n\n\n<p>The point of this kind of research isn&#8217;t about &#8220;proving&#8221; whether or not Cobain was a trans woman. These journeys of reclamation are about something else entirely. In the present era, when transness is treated like an evil contagion by the right, and those who try to erase us and deny us care like to claim that we&#8217;re some kind of new invention, it&#8217;s important to remember that there have always been people like us out there. Even if many of our trancestors couldn&#8217;t have safely come out or didn&#8217;t have any words to define themselves with, that doesn&#8217;t make them less important to us as figures to look up to and take hope from. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Responding to a <a href=\"https://www.tumblr.com/waskurttrans/697394986130489344/kurt-cobain-will-have-his-revenge-on-the-straights\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">popular post about Cobain&#8217;s transness on Tumblr years back</a>, one trans woman put it perfectly. &#8220;The point of the post,&#8221; she says, &#8220;is not that kurt cobain was a trans woman, or even that kurt cobain was an egg. the point of the post is that us trans people are <em>never</em> allowed to claim our dead&#8230;no amount of evidence would ever convince a cis person that kurt cobain wasn&#8217;t one of them. the point is that cis people always get to claim <em>anyone</em> as one of their own, and we never do.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, there can be a benefit to speculating on the identities of gender-nonconforming figures from the past. Too often, the idea of respecting the dead puts an unfair burden on the living. We know trans people did exist before us, and claiming certain figures is a way of remind ourselves of the long, proud legacy we&#8217;ve always had, and that too many of us are barred from learning about. To claim someone as trans is a way of celebrating who they were and the impact they had on the culture. More importantly, it&#8217;s a necessary part of getting through this uniquely transphobic moment in time. </p>\n\n\n\n  <div class=\" adb-inarticle\">\n      </div>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;If he was here today,&#8221; Juno Stump wrote in <a href=\"https://unwinnable.com/2024/04/05/dont-hurt-girls-when-you-dance-or-any-other-time-kurt-cobain-nirvana/\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a post for Unwinnable last year</a>, &#8220;he‚Äôd say something cool, like ‚ÄúGod is gay‚Äù or ‚ÄúMay women rule the world,‚Äù but he‚Äôd also most certainly say ‚Äútrans rights.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s something we can be sure of. </p>\n<p>Sign up for the¬†<a href=\"https://www.queerty.com/newsletter/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Queerty</strong></em><strong> newsletter</strong></a>¬†to stay on top of the hottest stories in LGBTQ+ entertainment, politics, and culture.</p>",

Not only did the <em>Star Wars</em> and <em>Indiana Jones</em> icon turn 83, but he also bagged his first Emmy nomination. It was for his role in the comedy, <em>Shrinking</em>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some fans have expressed shock that this is only his first Emmy nomination. Then again, given that the Emmys tend to be for small-screen roles, and the bulk of Ford‚Äôs performances have been on the big screen, it shouldn‚Äôt be all <em>that</em> surprising.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To many people, Ford shot to fame in 1977 playing Han Solo in <em>Star Wars</em>. However, he‚Äôd been a jobbing actor for several years before this, juggling his acting with work as a carpenter to help support himself and his family.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n  <blockquote>\n    <h3>How about we take this to the next level?</h3>\n    <p>\n      Subscribe to our newsletter for a refreshing cocktail (or mocktail) of LGBTQ+ entertainment and pop culture, served up with a side of eye-candy.<br />\n      <a href=\"https://www.queerty.com/newsletter/\"><strong>Subscribe to our Newsletter today</strong></a>\n    </p>\n  </blockquote>\n\n  <div class=\" adb-inarticle\">\n      </div>\n\n\n\n<p>One of his notable early roles was in <em>American Graffiti</em> in 1973. The film was pivotal to his career because it inevitably helped him land his role in <em>Star Wars</em>. George Lucas directed both movies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ford also landed a small role in Francis Ford Coppola&#8217;s film, <em>The Conversation</em> (1974). What many people didn‚Äôt realize, even to this day, is that Ford decided to play his character as gay.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">&#8220;The Conversation&#8221;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The Conversation</em>, a noirish thriller,&nbsp;stars the late Gene Hackman as a shadowy surveillance expert.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although not mentioned on screen, and not widely discussed by the production team, Ford decided to give his office assistant character more backstory.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‚ÄúThere was no role there until I decided to make him a homosexual,‚Äù Ford later <a href=\"https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/new-suit-harrison-ford-break-down-lgbtq-boundaries/\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> of his character, Martin Stett.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"Harrison Ford as Martin Stett in 'The Conversation' (Photo: Paramount Pictures)\" class=\"wp-image-814764\" height=\"410\" src=\"https://adabgmwwup.cloudimg.io/v7/_queerty-prodweb_/2025/07/harrison-ford-conversation-cropped.jpg?auto=format&#038;auto=compress&#038;width=1088&#038;org_if_sml=1\" width=\"780\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Harrison Ford as Martin Stett in &#8216;The Conversation&#8217;</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n  <div class=\" adb-inarticle\">\n      </div>\n\n\n\n<p>Ford had first auditioned for the role of Mark. That eventually went to Frederic Forrest. Ford instead landed a much smaller role. To make Stett stand out, Ford personally spent $900 (approximately $5,900 in today&#8217;s money) on a green flannel suit that he felt suited his character. Deciding to play a character as gay was a bold move in Hollywood at the time, particularly for a struggling actor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Brad Duke in his biography, <em>Harrison Ford: The Films</em>, ‚ÄúArriving on the set in a newly purchased $900 green flannel suit, Ford approached his director, who was hardly able to contain his astonishment. When Ford described his intentions to the bewildered Coppola, the director happily granted the actor permission to play his first screen homosexual. As a result, the office set was modified to better suit the film&#8217;s latest personality.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coppola liked the idea so much that he expanded the role for Ford.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stett&#8217;s sexuality is not stated but the character is subtly queer-coded (eg. he bakes his own cookies). He&#8217;s thankfully also not portrayed as a flamboyant stereotype. His orientation undoubtedly went over the heads of most audiences. However, for others, it perhaps added to the suggestion of the character‚Äôs hiding something or not telling the whole truth.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Watch a clip below.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n  <div class=\" adb-inarticle\">\n      </div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Interestingly, a 4K-restoration of <em>The Conversation</em> hit screens last year to mark its 50th anniversary. A new trailer highlighted Ford&#8217;s role considerably more than the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elJL5D6HTvA\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">original trailer</a> did all those years ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n  <div class=\" adb-inarticle\">\n      </div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Support for same-sex marriage</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ford is a lifelong Democrat who has expressed support for LGBTQ+ rights, including same-sex marriage. In 2013, he played a role in the movie <em>Ender‚Äôs Game</em>, based on a novel of the same name by Orson Scott Card. Card previously made anti-gay comments, leading some people to call for a boycott of the movie.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ford told <em>The Guardian</em> at the time, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs well known Orson Scott Card and I have different views on the issue of gay marriage and gay rights. It has been a real dilemma for me: I love the book ‚ÄòEnder‚Äôs Game,‚Äô it‚Äôs all about tolerance and compassion, and understanding the other.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‚ÄúShould I not have made the film because of his views?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúI wrestled with that, and you know what? I thought: if I don‚Äôt put these ideas out on screen we wouldn‚Äôt be having this conversation. We are having this conversation precisely because the themes of the book are at odds with his current ideas. I‚Äôm very proud of the film, and I felt strongly that I didn‚Äôt want to lose my love of this book because its creator seems to be in a different zone to me on this issue.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n  <div class=\" adb-inarticle\">\n      </div>\n\n\n\n<p>Ford has received one Oscar nomination (<em>Witness</em> in 1986) and four Golden Globe nominations (<em>Witness</em>, <em>The Mosquito Coast</em>, <em>The Fugitive</em>, and <em>Sabrina</em>). He has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and an Honorary Palme d&#8217;Or, among many other accolades.</p>\n\n\n\n  <blockquote>\n    <h3>Related</h3>\n                          <p>\n              <a href=\"https://www.queerty.com/michael-urie-explains-to-harrison-ford-why-lots-of-gay-men-love-the-movie-working-girl-20250214/?utm_source=rss&#038;utm_medium=related_links&#038;utm_campaign=michael-urie-explains-to-harrison-ford-why-lots-of-gay-men-love-the-movie-working-girl\">\n                <strong>Michael Urie explains to Harrison Ford why so many gay men love the movie ‚ÄòWorking Girl‚Äô</strong>\n              </a><br />\n              Urie stars in the show &#8216;Shrinking&#8217; alongside Ford and Jason Segel.¬†            </p>\n            </blockquote>\n\n<p>Sign up for the¬†<a href=\"https://www.queerty.com/newsletter/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Queerty</strong></em><strong> newsletter</strong></a>¬†to stay on top of the hottest stories in LGBTQ+ entertainment, politics, and culture.</p>",

We&#8217;ve already got plenty of questions about this case, so let&#8217;s dig in&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n  <div class=\" adb-inarticle\">\n      </div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. <strong>Why do so many people go missing on boats?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At first glance, there would seem to be an obvious answer to this. When you&#8217;re out in the middle of the ocean, accidents happen, and murders definitely happen. If you&#8217;re not forever haunted by the baffling at-sea death of <a href=\"https://www.queerty.com/watch-return-gay-cop-lesbian-thriller-unraveling-hollywood-mystery-20200507/\">Hollywood icon and LGBTQ+ ally Natalie Wood</a>, there&#8217;s probably another sea death that occupies way too much space in your brain. It&#8217;s a combination of not being able to really investigate the scene of the crime and having no recourse to physical evidence. Even if someone disappears at sea, it&#8217;s likely that their body, or parts of it, will eventually wash up on shore somewhere. These cases are notoriously hard to solve, meaning that families of victims like Bradley are stuck in the limbo of never actually knowing what happened to their loved one, and potentially never being able to find out.</p>\n\n\n\n  <div class=\" adb-inarticle\">\n      </div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. <strong>Did Amy&#8217;s queerness have anything to do with her disappearance?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Amy Bradley was an out lesbian woman, and 1998 was also the year that Matthew Shepard lost his own life to homophobic violence. That said, we don&#8217;t know that Amy&#8217;s sexuality had anything to do with what happened to her. It&#8217;s definitely an intriguing detail of the case, but those who knew Amy say that they don&#8217;t believe that Amy could have taken her own life, and there&#8217;s little evidence to suggest that Amy&#8217;s lesbian identity was the cause for her being targeted. While she was hesitant to come out to her parents, who were less than accepting at the time, it seems far fetched to assume that this would have created any kind of murderous rift in the family. </p>\n\n\n\n  <div class=\" adb-inarticle\">\n      </div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong> 3. Why is there so much renewed interest in the case?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s been 27 years since Bradley went missing, and her family hasn&#8217;t abandoned the search. Because there are so many loose ends to the case‚Äîincluding the question of whether or not Bradley is in fact alive‚Äîit&#8217;s hard imagine a clear resolution to the story, especially after so many years. The implication that Bradley may have been the victim of s*x trafficking, however, makes this story unfortunately evergreen, as this still seems to be very much a problem in the cruise industry. In 2005, a similar disappearence on a cruise ship‚Äîthat of <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/natalee-holloway-joran-van-der-sloot-c875cf1fa3c558bd7c676c2e47662a4f\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">18-year-old Natalee Holloway</a>‚Äîsparked a new wave of interest in Bradley&#8217;s case. But while Holloway&#8217;s killer has been found, what happened to Bradley is still a mystery.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. <strong>  Did Amy Bradley have a girlfriend?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes‚ÄîBradley&#8217;s girlfriend, Mollie McClure, is interviewed in the documentary. McClure does not believe that suicide was a possibility in Bradley&#8217;s case, since the two were deeply in love and had just started a new life together, complete with a new dog. There were problems in the relationship, but Amy&#8217;s last message to McClure seems very much like an SOS. It read: ‚ÄúI feel like there is an ocean between us.&nbsp;Like I‚Äôm on a desert island waiting for you to rescue me. A message in a bottle is my only hope. I miss you, Mollie. Save me please. Stranded, Amy.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n  <div class=\" adb-inarticle\">\n      </div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong> 5. What is the parental role in all this?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We know that Bradley&#8217;s parents were aware of her lesbian identity, and that they were still coming to terms with it when Bradley disappeared. But, honestly, it seems like the family would have come around to accepting Bradley&#8217;s queerness if they&#8217;d had more time. Of all the likely culprits in this case, Bradley&#8217;s family doesn&#8217;t seem to belong very high on the list.</p>\n\n\n\n  <div class=\" adb-inarticle\">\n      </div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>6. Have there been recent updates on the case?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes and no‚Äîthe information presented in the documentary is intriguing, but apart from the interviews with people who were on the ship that night, nothing is exactly new here. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>7. What&#8217;s the most likely theory about what happened here?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many people believe in the Occam&#8217;s Razor explanation that she was drunk after dancing and fell overboard without a trace. However, there are many intriguing details of the case, including the fact that several people have claimed to see Amy in the years after her disappearance. Ultimately‚Äîas with all mysteries of this kind‚Äîit depends on what, and who, you believe. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Bradley did simply drown, the boat was near enough to Cura√ßao, one of the cruise&#8217;s first island stops, that her body almost certainly would have washed up within a matter of days, which is why the drowning theory has been called into question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amy&#8217;s family believes she&#8217;s still out there, and every day they&#8217;re waiting for new information to come to light.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‚ÄúSomebody knows something,&#8221; Bradley&#8217;s mother <a href=\"https://www.the-sun.com/news/14728003/amy-bradley-vanished-cruise-clues-alive/\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">told The Sun</a> recently. &#8220;We were told by an FBI agent, ‚ÄòKeep your lights on. Nobody can keep a secret their entire life&#8217;.‚Äù She continued, stating: ‚ÄúWe keep her car in the garage at home, out of the weather and polished. It‚Äôs going to be pristine when she gets here. And then she‚Äôll get to drive it again.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n  <blockquote>\n    <h3>Related</h3>\n                          <p>\n              <a href=\"https://www.queerty.com/trmps-doodlegate-has-us-wondering-is-it-gay-to-send-pervy-drawings-to-your-friends-20250718/?utm_source=rss&#038;utm_medium=related_links&#038;utm_campaign=trmps-doodlegate-has-us-wondering-is-it-gay-to-send-pervy-drawings-to-your-friends\">\n                <strong>Tr*mp&#8217;s doodlegate has us wondering: Is it gay to send pervy drawings to your friends?</strong>\n              </a><br />\n              Asking for an enemy             </p>\n            </blockquote>\n\n<p>Sign up for the¬†<a href=\"https://www.queerty.com/newsletter/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Queerty</strong></em><strong> newsletter</strong></a>¬†to stay on top of the hottest stories in LGBTQ+ entertainment, politics, and culture.</p>",

Boris is worried they settled down too soon, and though they still have love for each other, he doesn&#8217;t want to be the reason Otto never sees the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thankfully he&#8217;s still got his lifelong best friend Lente (Jennifer Heylen) by his side&#8230; that is, until she shares that she, too, is ready to explore life beyond Brussels. Suddenly feeling like his world&#8217;s been pulled out from under him, Otto begins to question want he&#8217;s actually into, and who he even is outside of his relationships.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-814417\" height=\"1029\" src=\"https://adabgmwwup.cloudimg.io/v7/_queerty-prodweb_/2025/07/ohotto-jonathanmichiels-jenniferheylen-ceyeworks-miloweiler-1544x1029.jpg?auto=format&#038;auto=compress&#038;width=1088&#038;org_if_sml=1\" width=\"1544\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Image Credit: &#8216;Oh, Otto!,&#8217; Streamz Belgium</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>But, with a little encouragement from Lente, he joins the dating apps for the first time, creating an online alter ego that gives him space to explore new sides of himself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, in turn, he gets to explore a whole new side of Brussels: The city&#8217;s surprisingly vibrant queer nightlife scene, one with plenty of new fun to explore in the forms of drag, leather, and anonymous dark room hookups.</p>\n\n\n\n  <blockquote>\n    <h3>Related</h3>\n                          <p>\n              <a href=\"https://www.queerty.com/from-90s-indies-to-short-lived-sitcoms-gays-reveal-the-most-underrated-queer-movies-shows-20250420/?utm_source=rss&#038;utm_medium=related_links&#038;utm_campaign=from-90s-indies-to-short-lived-sitcoms-gays-reveal-the-most-underrated-queer-movies-shows\">\n                <strong>From ‚Äò90s indies to short-lived sitcoms: Gays reveal the most underrated queer movies &#038; shows</strong>\n              </a><br />\n              When we asked Queerty readers to submit their most underrated gay movies and TV shows, they understood the assignment!             </p>\n            </blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n  <div class=\" adb-inarticle\">\n      </div>\n\n\n\n<p>Also among the ensemble are hunky Dutch actor Tarikh Janssen, whose *<em>ahem</em>* <a href=\"https://x.com/omgblog/status/1945488377316610338\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">whole-hog scenes are making the rounds online</a>, and former EuroVision contestant Mustii, best known stateside as a judge on <em>Drag Race Belgique</em>, who <a href=\"https://x.com/Ivushka21/status/1940903553289408885\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">performs in drag in the series</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here, check out the Dutch-language trailer, and pro-tip if you don&#8217;t speak the language: Toggle on YouTube&#8217;s auto-translated captions so you can understand what they&#8217;re saying.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The seven-episode series debuted on Belgian streamer Streamz earlier this month, and though it&#8217;s not currently available to watch stateside (unless you know your way around international VPNs), the campaign to bring it to America starts here and now!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s because, even in an age of increased queer representation on our TV screens, our options are severely lacking in more grown-up dramas specifically focused on the LGBTQ+ experience. From the looks of it, <em>Oh, Otto!</em> is a show unafraid of tackling more mature themes, the intricacies of adult relationships, and showing a little skin, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, <em>Looking</em>&#8216;s been off the air for almost a decade, that <em>Queer As Folk</em> reboot never really got a chance to find its audience, and <em>Fellow Travelers</em> was only a one-and-done series. We need more scripted dramas willing to show off a little man bum, no?</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-814416\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://adabgmwwup.cloudimg.io/v7/_queerty-prodweb_/2025/07/ohotto-1-ceyeworksmiloweiler-bewerkt.jpeg?auto=format&#038;auto=compress&#038;width=1088&#038;org_if_sml=1\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Image Credit: &#8216;Oh, Otto!,&#8217; Streamz Belgium</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n  <div class=\" adb-inarticle\">\n      </div>\n\n\n\n<p>In all seriousness, <em>Oh, Otto!</em> shares an important message it feels like the world could stand to hear right now. When it recently won the Bets Short-form Series award at the Cannes International Series Festival, the jury wrote the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In a world where polarization is increasingly prevailing, this intimate yet universal story reminds us of series like <em>Oh, Otto!</em> are necessary now more than ever and that in the law of love everyone is equal.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, exactly&#8230; and it also helps that the guys in the show are incredibly handsome.

Is that so wrong to say?</p>\n\n\n\n  <div class=\" adb-inarticle\">\n      </div>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\"><div style=\"padding: 16px;\"> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CD1rl4YJpXB/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" style=\"line-height: 0;

There, the government suddenly moved to dismiss her application for asylum.

    "content": "<p>D.C. Attorney General Brian L. Schwalb announced on July 15 that the pharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences will pay $316,413 to the District as part of a settlement of civil allegations that it engaged in an illegal kickback scheme with doctors to promote&nbsp;and sell its HIV medication.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A statement released by Schwalb says Gilead allegedly violated D.C. and federal false claims laws ‚Äúby paying doctors and other healthcare providers to promote and prescribe its suite of HIV medications over those marketed by its competitors.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The statement adds, ‚ÄúBecause the resulting insurance claims filed with the District‚Äôs Medicaid program were induced by kickbacks, they violated the District‚Äôs False Claims Act ((FCA).‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gilead‚Äôs $316,413 payment to D.C. is part of a total of $202 million the drug company agreed to pay in April of this year to 46 states and the District to settle a lawsuit initially filed against it in 2016 over illegal kickback allegations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‚ÄúFor years, Gilead Sciences illegally boosted sales by paying lavish kickbacks to doctors, and in so doing, cheated both District patients and taxpayers,‚Äù Schwalb said in his statement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‚ÄúGilead develops, manufacturers, and sells medications for the treatment of infectious diseases, including HIV/AIDS,‚Äù the statement continues. ‚ÄúA federal and multistate investigation revealed that between 2011 and 2017, Gilead administered a kickback program for its suite of HIV medications whereby 548 healthcare providers received over $23.7 million in honoraria payments, in addition to extravagant meals and paid travel expenses,‚Äù the statement says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It says these payments were part of Gilead‚Äôs ‚ÄúHIV Speaker Programs‚Äù intended to entice the doctors to prescribe Gilead‚Äôs drugs. ‚ÄúThroughout this period, Gilead caused claims for&nbsp;payment for its HIV medication ‚Äì induced by the illegal kickbacks ‚Äì to be submitted to the District‚Äôs Medicaid program,‚Äù Schwalb‚Äôs statement says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a statement at the time of the settlement in April, Gilead said it ‚Äúentered into this agreement to avoid the cost and distraction of potential litigation regarding this legacy compliance matter.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The statement adds, ‚ÄúGilead‚Äôs speaker programs have served to educate healthcare professionals about the appropriate use and benefits of these important medications ‚Ä¶ Gilead‚Äôs therapies have transformed the treatment paradigm for HIV, and Gilead will continue to drive innovation to meet patients‚Äô needs.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While under criticism for the alleged &nbsp;kickback scheme, Gilead received favorable news coverage in June when the U.S. Food&nbsp;and Drug Administration approved a new HIV prevention medication developed by Gilead called lenacapavir that needs to be taken by injection once every six months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Public health experts and AIDS activists called the new HIV prevention, or PrEP, drug, which testing showed to be greater than 99 percent effective in preventing HIV infection, a major advancement in the years-long effort to end the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the U.S. and worldwide.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.washingtonblade.com/2025/07/18/d-c-to-receive-300000-from-gilead-for-illegal-kickback-scheme/\">D.C. to receive $300,000 from Gilead for ‚Äòillegal kickback scheme‚Äô</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.washingtonblade.com\">Washington Blade: LGBTQ News, Politics, LGBTQ Rights, Gay News</a>.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Donald Trump has held the presidency for less than six months in 2025. But already, trans people have been defaced, demoralized, and fatigued. On June 18, the Supreme Court upheld a ban on gender affirming care for trans youth in nearly half of U.S. states. This ensures that trans youth do not have access to hormone blockers that prevent them from becoming their hated gender.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Trump administration has also ensured that Medicaid can no longer provide subsidized and insurance-covered care to trans adults. In addition to this, Trump‚Äôs White House has banned trans people from the military and has stripped all government agencies and universities of having Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) departments. Even progressive minded institutions like Yale (my alma mater) and Harvard have stripped themselves of DEI. Trump‚Äôs cruelty knows no bounds.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This month, former president Obama stated over Instagram that Trump‚Äôs administration was becoming more and more like an autocracy. Recently, a tourist was stripped of his U.S. visa when federal agents discovered a JD Vance meme on his phone.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ICE is raiding more and more immigrant families‚Äìimmigrants who provide critical labor to our U.S. fields and other important industries. Immigrant children are forced to stand testimony and defend themselves‚Äìwithout a lawyer‚Äìin court. The United States, in other words, is becoming more and more like a fascist state. Look no further than Trump‚Äôs removal of the Kennedy Center board, and his ban of a Pride event at the Kennedy Center. During his campaign years, Trump held queer events for ‚ÄúLGB‚Äù folk ‚Äî but made sure to drop the ‚ÄúT‚Äù, because it is becoming all too apparent that he is cruel to trans people.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a past article I wrote for the Blade, I stated that not <a href=\"https://www.washingtonblade.com/2025/03/26/opinion-arlington-trans-sanctuary-city/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">enough trans people are scared</a> in the U.S. right now. Other countries, including European countries, are quickly warning their trans citizens against traveling to the U.S., citing the fact that we are a hostile place for folks like them. Unfortunately, this is true.¬†</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trans people have to start looking to move to sanctuary states right now. In fact, we have already been doing this for many years: trans citizens have been fleeing red, conservative states‚Äìstates where men shoot trans women (and trans men). But now is the time to do so more than ever. Check out outcoast.com for a useful list of some sanctuary cities for trans people in the U.S. right now. But other cities not on the list, including my college town of New Haven, Connecticut, are also welcoming places for trans people.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Transgender Americans have to take into consideration the fact that Trump and his cronies have sought to overthrow us in just less than six months‚Äô time. They are trying to make us weak, vulnerable, up for the taking. Yet we have to stand strong amid all the attacks from Republican lawmakers. One has to question the fact that ICE is starting to use social media to go after any naysayer ‚Äî and deliberate whether ICE will be going after trans Americans in two or three years to come. If Trump is doing so much damage to the trans community already, what will be happening in 2028? A move to Canada can surely be on the horizon.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Transgender Americans need to be scared right now. But more than just scared, we need to be taking action.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br /><em><strong>Isaac Amend</strong> is a writer based in the D.C. area.

    "title": "Rise in sex parties in Brazil upends country‚Äôs gay nightlife",
    "content": "<p>Gay nightlife in Brazil, especially in Rio de Janeiro and other cities with great tourist, is going through a difficult time. If in the past there were countless LGBTQ nightclubs scattered around the city, with the vast majority of them in Copacabana, today there are no more than six in the area.¬†</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The emergence of the internet and later dating apps made it possible to meet someone through a small screen without having to go to a nightclub. But it wasn&#8217;t just the digital world that had an influence on this; several other issues also contributed to the decline of Brazilian gay nightlife. To better understand this new scenario, the Washington Blade spoke to veteran artists from Brazil‚Äôs LGBTQ scene to understand the roots of this complex enigma.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cost of maintaining a nightclub involves high and fixed expenses, such as rent, staff for various functions, attractions, and other bills, when financial return was guaranteed in the past, but not today. Brazil&#8217;s gay nightlife, especially in Rio, hasn&#8217;t gone extinct, it&#8217;s still resisting, but competing with new trends: sex parties. In recent years, they have become more and more frequent in the ‚ÄúCidade Maravilhosa‚Äù or the ‚ÄúMarvelous City‚Äù as Rio is known and their main focus is group sex.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spread between the city‚Äôs South and Central Zones, they take place on regular dates, in fixed or itinerant locations, such as saunas and old mansions. They are always on a differentiated schedule that can involve go-go boys, open bars, and other attractions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s impossible to talk about the success of these spicy parties without having a look at gay nightlife in the past; and the changes that took place during the 1990s and 2000s, when the internet was just becoming popular and a new generation was being born. If in the past, gay nightclubs were a place to dance, drink, flirt, and maybe end the night with someone, these stages have been skipped for something much more immediate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/machomanclub/\">MachoMan</a>, one of Rio‚Äôs most famous sex parties, brings together a male audience of around 130 participants at each edition. The event has grown and is currently held in three different places: a mansion, a sauna, and a bar. Over the seven years of its existence, the party&#8217;s creator, Maur√≠cio Code, estimates that 25,000 men have been there. Asked about the popularity of adult parties in parallel with the decline of nightclubs, he replied: &#8220;In times of immediacy when it comes to libido, many people want to skip the flirting phase and get straight to the point. Less talk and more action is the premise of the new times.&#8221;¬†</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the organizer, there are guarantees at a carnal party, which can be uncertain at a nightclub.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‚ÄúAt sex parties, the guarantee of some sexual interaction is a certainty,‚Äù he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MachoMan has had upwards of 220 parties. Some of them offer an open bar, changing rooms, showers, a steam room, and even places for BDSM and other fetishes. Unlike the nightclubs that had darkrooms for anonymous pleasure in the dark, the pleasure at these parties is collective and in front of everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-98972031\" height=\"1502\" src=\"https://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2025/07/MachoMan_party_poster_insert_courtesy_MachoMan.jpg\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>A flyer for a MachoMan party (Photo courtesy of MachoMan)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another issue to be considered is that the cost of these sex parties is lower than that of nightclubs; since the events take place on specific dates, the professionals involved (bartenders, DJs, cleaners, go-go boys, bodyguards, etc.) are hired just for that occasion. The rented space can host other events ‚Äî straight or gay ‚Äî on other dates ‚Äî with our without erotic appeal. Because they don&#8217;t take place on specific days, this also creates an expectation among the audience for the next party..</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, the only obstacle to these libidinous parties is competition.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are currently dozens taking place almost simultaneously in Rio and other cities. The schedule varies little, but they always have beautiful naked men with bodies sculpted in the gym entering a male audience eager for pleasure. Raphael Habbib is one of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although he is Brazilian, he has Arab features and is one of the most sought-after go-go boys, appearing at many libertine parties with his sensual performances. For him, the phenomenon of erotic parties is associated with a change in behavior.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‚ÄúThe gay audience has changed, we are now more willing to experience sexuality in a more genuine way, exploring all forms of enjoyment,‚Äù said Habbib.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regarding the collapse of nightclubs, he reflects: ‚ÄúSex parties have a nightclub atmosphere, music, booze, and lots of sex with no compromise, in other words, they have everything that nightclubs used to have and more.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-98972030\" height=\"1800\" src=\"https://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2025/07/Brazil_men_making_out_insert_courtesy_Raphael_Habbib.jpg\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>(Photo courtesy of Raphael Habbib)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-portrait-of-the-past-gay-scene\">A portrait of the past gay scene</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the 1980s and 1990s in Brazil; nightlife was a meeting of tribes, of subcultures, each occupying their own space and, above all, expressing their sexuality after a full day of repression at work. In this sense, nightlife was a place to let loose, enjoy, drink, and interact, even if the hangover came the next day. The big urban centers had endless nights, streets full until dawn, and pleasant encounters came about by chance. There has been a transformation that not only involves the rise of the internet, but also economic crisis and violence. Nightlife is quieter, and there is no single culprit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, since the 2000s, the LGBTQ nightlife scene has been changing by leaps and bounds. Nightlife entrepreneurs have had to reinvent themselves as their audiences have migrated elsewhere; and some, even though they were looking for innovation, ended up closing their doors a few years later.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Veteran drag queen Eula Rochard has been on stage since 1984 and has followed all these changes closely. For her, the advance of LGBTQ policies in Brazil since the late 1990s has caused the gay community to spread to other places where they were not welcome before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While in terms of rights it was progress, on the other hand, there was a move away from gay &#8220;ghettos.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;People who used to hide from home to go to nightclubs no longer hide,‚Äù said Rochard. ‚ÄúIn the 1980s, everything was hidden, the nightclubs were ghettos, there were several at the time, the fees were bad, but there was a lot of work. I traveled the country.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rochard, however, recognizes the importance of these policies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‚ÄúThat was great, because in my time people were killed and nothing happened (impunity), but businessmen no longer wanted to invest in nightclubs, if a gay person could go or kiss anywhere, so the nightlife for us gays has weakened a lot, it&#8217;s almost non-existent,‚Äù she said.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-98972032\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2025/07/Eula_Richard_insert_courtesy_Eula_Richard.jpg\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em><strong>Eula Richard</strong> (Photo courtesy of Eula Richard)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Rochard in 2023 made international headlines when she revealed that former U.S. Rep. George Santos (R-N.Y.) was once a drag queen known as Kitara Ravache who performed in Rio and in the nearby city of Niter√≥i,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trans artist Angelika Rawaxi shares the same opinion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Nowadays we have the chance to go to other places, we have laws in our favor, and we don&#8217;t have to be in ghettos anymore,‚Äù said Rawaxi. ‚ÄúWhat has contributed is the freedom we&#8217;ve been given to go to other places and expand our work.&#8221;¬†</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both don&#8217;t believe that the internet has harmed gay nightlife, on the contrary. In terms of relationships, however, the online world has presented a problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;People used to go to gay clubs to kiss, to find a boyfriend, and that&#8217;s over,‚Äù lamented Rawaxi. ‚ÄúToday gay people go to dating apps, no one meets by looking, by touching, by dancing to a song like they used to.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-98972029\" height=\"798\" src=\"https://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2025/07/Angelika_Rawaxi_insert_courtesy_Angelika_Rawaxi.jpg\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em><strong>Angelika Rawaxi</strong> (Photo courtesy of Angelika Rawaxi)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The now-closed Le Boy was Rio&#8217;s most popular gay nightclub.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 1970s inspired its decor, with mirrored globes, sofas, and a Studio 54 vibe. Calvin Klein, Jean-Paul Gaultier, Rupert Everett, Rihanna, and Katy Perry are among the celebrities who were seen at Le Boy. It remained open from 1992-2016, but succumbed to the economic crisis and its French owner put the property up for sale after 24 years. Another gay nightclub opened in the same place in 2024, and it is one of the few remaining in Copacabana.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the LGBTQ establishments closed their doors, the drag queens and crossdressers who used to perform on stage had to look for other ways.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Businessman J√∫nior Barbosa, owner of Rio&#8217;s most notorious gay sauna, was a pioneer when he hired these artists to perform at his establishment in Copacabana. The initiative represented a new field of work for those who depended on LGBTQ nightclubs. Others, like drag queen Gabrielly Rodin, were able to reinvent themselves and migrated to straight parties and other events.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‚ÄúI went to other venues, and I always had acceptance and financial return,‚Äù Rodin told the Blade.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rodin attributes the decline of LGBTQ nightlife to the replacement of drag queens by DJs, and to the open bar that devalued the artists, as if the crowd were more interested in drinking than enjoying a performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-lgbtq-nightlife-decline-is-not-unique-to-brazil\">LGBTQ nightlife decline is not unique to Brazil</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Germany since the 1990s has seen the same transition as Brazil.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‚ÄúClubsterben‚Äù is a German expression that means ‚Äúdeath of nightclub culture,‚Äù especially in Berlin, a previous oasis of the techno scene.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Wilde Renate, a nightclub in a poorly maintained building, will close at the end of the year, while the Watergate closed its doors at the end of 2024 after 22 years. A <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250113-is-berlins-famous-club-scene-ending\">report </a>carried out in November by an organization representing Berlin&#8217;s clubs revealed that half of the 250 or so nightclubs in the German capital are at risk of closing their doors this year. Berlin&#8217;s nightlife is not at its best, and the rest of the world in general.¬†</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-98972033\" height=\"799\" src=\"https://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2025/07/20240400_Schwuz_club_in_Berlin_insert_c_Washington_Blade_by_Michael_K_Lavers.jpg\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Schwuz, a gay club in a former brewery in Berlin, in April 2024.

Therefore, the death of the Berlin or Rio nightclubs is not an isolated situation, but a reality in the ever-changing world, as well as a generational change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Against the backdrop of the Brazilian crisis, La Cueva nightclub is an exception.¬†</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has been in business since 1964 and is Latin America‚Äôs oldest gay club. The underground nightclub in Copacabana has withstood the dictatorship of the 1960s and 1970s, the AIDS epidemic of the 1980s, the economic crises of the 1990s. Its longevity may be associated with its strictly mature audience (on average over 55) who still prefer eye-to-eye contact and dancing to flashbacks, and are probably not so adept at virtual media.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-98972028\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2025/07/La_Cueva_in_Brazil_insert_c_Washington_Blade_by_Michael_K_Lavers.jpg\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>La Cueva opened in 1964 (Washington Blade photo by Michael K.

Interaction between people seems to have lost a bit of its meaning. They‚Äôre not disconnected from the virtual world, even when they are with friends in bars. They‚Äôre always with their eyes fixed on their cell phone, sometimes forgetting about the real world. Going to a club in the hope of not only dancing, but also meeting someone interesting, having a relationship, and perhaps a night of sex, has become too slow-paced.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‚ÄúWhat is the future of the gay nightlife scene for drag queens and trans women, who in the past performed several times a night in nightclubs? Opinions differ.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‚ÄúThe future of LGBTQ+ artists in Rio is tragic, nowadays, we&#8217;re working for very low fees, because many are doing shows for free,‚Äù complains Rawaxi.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rodin is more confident.¬†</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‚ÄúToday we can occupy all spaces and not just the ‚Äòghettos,‚Äô we are renewing ourselves, being seen by everyone, we can&#8217;t just accept the bubble that society forces us to live in,‚Äù they said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rochard doesn&#8217;t have the same optimism.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;‚ÄúI don&#8217;t see a future in Brazil as far as nightlife is concerned, the clubs need to reinvent themselves, they won&#8217;t cease to exist; but they won&#8217;t be the same as in the past, but our drag queen culture will never end,‚Äù she said.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.washingtonblade.com/2025/07/18/rise-in-sex-parties-in-brazil-upends-countrys-gay-nightlife/\">Rise in sex parties in Brazil upends country‚Äôs gay nightlife</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.washingtonblade.com\">Washington Blade: LGBTQ News, Politics, LGBTQ Rights, Gay News</a>.</p>",

Male athletes seem to be totally out or not, while many queer women occupy a space where they can be out without having to announce it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the top pick in the recent WNBA draft, Bueckers is a major star, and Fudd was part of a championship-winning UConn team, so their relationship is getting attention. But it&#8217;s not nearly the amount had a top NBA player been open about a relationship with a man. It&#8217;s why in compiling <a href=\"https://www.outsports.com/2024/8/13/24098536/2024-summer-olympics-paris-record-lgbtq-out-athletes/\">our list of out LGBTQ Olympians</a> in Paris, we combed through social media accounts of athletes and found a slew of women living openly on social media and no men.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s great that Bueckers and Fudd have found each other and that they are allowed to share as much of it they want with the public. It is progress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Subscribe to the <a href=\"https://www.outsports.com/newsletter/\"><em><strong>Outsports</strong></em> <strong>newsletter</strong></a> to keep up with your favorite out athletes, inspiring LGBTQ sports stories, and more.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.outsports.com/2025/7/18/24115704/paige-bueckers-confirms-that-she-and-ex-uconn-teammate-azzi-fudd-are-girlfriends-ebxdl/\">Paige Bueckers confirms that she and ex-UConn teammate Azzi Fudd are girlfriends</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.outsports.com\">Outsports</a>.</p>",

After playing golf for his high school team, he transitioned to focusing on the business of the sport, attending the University of Maryland Eastern Shore and joining the <a href=\"https://wwwcp.umes.edu/pga/\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">PGA Golf Management</a> program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‚ÄúIt teaches you how to be a golf pro,&#8221; he said of the program. &#8220;Running your day-to-day golf course. Typically it teaches you the program side. At my school it taught me the hospitality side of the industry.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His career has brought him to Golf Digest, Golf Channel, Belle Haven Country Club in Virginia, Peninsula Golf &amp; Country Club in Delaware and scores of other places.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His passion for the sport stems from a golf course&#8217;s ability to bring people together, four by four.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‚ÄúIt is a connecting sport. It‚Äôs one of the few places you can be with a group of people &#8212; at a <a href=\"https://topgolf.com/us/\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Top Golf</a> setting or a traditional golf course &#8212; for four hours and really meet the person and hear what drew them to picking up a golf club.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n\n  <div class=\" adb-os-inarticle\">\n      </div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>To be sure, Frazier loves just playing the game itself as well. There are so many ways to complete a golf course, and every time he approaches a course is different. A shot goes here, a putt goes there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‚ÄúYou have 18 holes nad 14 clubs and everyone trying to get the ball into the hole as fast as possible. It brings out the best of people. You get your highs, your lows, your problem solving. And you get some great memories out of it.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding to Frazier‚Äôs great memories of the game is now the <a href=\"https://www.outsports.com/2025/6/12/24113421/world-pride-capital-cup-washington-dc-gay-lgbtq-athletes/\">World Pride Capital Cup</a>, held last month in Washington, D.C., and which partnered with the LPGA and USGA. The golf tournament celebrating World Pride in the nation&#8217;s capital brought together LGBTQ people from across the sport, getting to know one another and challenging themselves and each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was &#8220;a once in a lifetime experience,&#8221; <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DKcEHsKRb_b/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Frazier wrote on Instagram</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n  <div class=\" adb-os-inarticle\">\n      </div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\"><div style=\"padding: 16px;\"> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DKcEHsKRb_b/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" style=\"line-height: 0; padding: 0 0; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; width: 100%;\" target=\"_blank\"> <div style=\"display: flex;\"> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"></div> <div style=\"display: flex;\"> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"></div> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"></div></div></div><div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"></div> <div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"></div><div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\"> <div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram</div></div><div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"></div> <div style=\"display: flex; margin-bottom: 14px;\"><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\"> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"></div> <div></div></div><div style=\"margin-left: auto;\"> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div> <div style=\"display: flex; margin-bottom: 24px;\"> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;\"></div> <div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; width: 144px;\"></div></div></a><p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; white-space: nowrap;\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DKcEHsKRb_b/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\" target=\"_blank\">A post shared by Langston Frazier, PGA (@langstonfrazier)</a></p></div></blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Yet combining his LGBTQ community and the sport he loves isn‚Äôt new to him.

But does it enhance my work? Yes. It‚Äôs not a defining factor, but being a teacher and helping produce stories about golf in general, the importance of highlighting different parts of the community, definitely gives me a different lens to tell stories.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Subscribe to the <a href=\"https://www.outsports.com/newsletter/\"><em><strong>Outsports</strong></em> <strong>newsletter</strong></a> to keep up with your favorite out athletes, inspiring LGBTQ sports stories, and more.</p>\n<div class=\"outstream-ad-holder\"><div class=\"adb-oplayer\" id=\"div-gpt-ad-outstreamplayer\"></div></div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.outsports.com/2025/7/18/24115635/langston-frazier-pga-tour-radio-america-gay-golf/\">Out golf professional tells the stories of golf at PGA Tour Radio</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.outsports.com\">Outsports</a>.</p>",

    "content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Trump administration shut down a national suicide hotline for LGBTQ youth on July 17, despite a significant increase in calls since late last year and bipartisan warnings against nixing the program.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), which is within the Department of Health and Human Services, had announced on June 17 that the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline, which served individuals under the age of 25, would \"no longer silo LGB+ youth services, also known as the ‚ÄúPress 3 option,‚Äù to focus on serving all help seekers, including those previously served through the Press 3 option.\"¬†</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The omission of ‚ÄúT‚Äù is consistent with the Trump administration‚Äôs erasure of transgender individuals.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">‚ÄúEveryone who contacts the 988 Lifeline will continue to receive access to skilled, caring, culturally competent crisis counselors who can help with suicidal, substance misuse, or mental health crises, or any other kind of emotional distress,‚Äù the statement noted. ‚ÄúAnyone who calls the Lifeline will continue to receive compassion and help.‚Äù</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The end of the program was announced on July 17. SAMHSA's own statistics show that while there were about 44,800 calls in May of last year, that number climbed north of 55,200 in September of 2024 and hit an all-time high by May of 2025, with more than 69,000 calls, according to <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-news/trump-shuts-down-lgbtq-youth-suicide-hotline-rcna219090\">NBC News</a>.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the same day the hotline was terminated, a bipartisan group of lawmakers ‚Äî including Republican Mike Lawler of New York ‚Äî hosted a press conference near the Capitol to urge the administration to keep the program going.</span>\n\n\"I‚Äôm proud to join the bipartisan effort to maintain the 988 line service,\" Lawler wrote in a post on X. \"Since its launch in 2022, the LGBTQ+ specialized line within 988 has responded to more than 1.3 million calls, texts, and chats. That is more than 2,100 contacts every single day. Every one of those contacts represents a young person who decided to reach out, to live, to be heard, and to get help.\"\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 988 Suicide &amp; Crisis Lifeline launched in the summer of 2022, but a more specific lifeline for LGBTQ people was established in October of that year under a pilot program worth $29.7 million. The following year, the funding increased to $33 million.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SAMHSA‚Äôs statement noted that the \"Press 3\" option was created under a government agreement with a third party. According to NBC News, The Trevor Project was initially the only provider who administered the service, but a total of seven providers ultimately were part of 988‚Äôs LGBTQ Youth Subnetwork</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to find the words today,\" The Trevor Project‚Äôs CEO, Jaymes Black, said in a written statement. \"Our country‚Äôs federal government ‚Äî including the very agency in charge of protecting our mental health ‚Äî cut a literal lifeline that has provided 1.5 million LGBTQ+ youth with suicide prevention services. It is unfathomable. This administration has made a dangerous decision to play politics with real young people‚Äôs lives. The 988 Lifeline‚Äôs Specialized Services Program was created to serve Americans at highest risk for suicide ‚Äî including veterans and LGBTQ+ youth ‚Äî with best-practice crisis care that meets these populations‚Äô unique needs.‚Äù</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Black added: ‚ÄúThe program was created with overwhelming bipartisan support because, despite our political differences, we should all agree that every young person‚Äôs life is worth saving. I am heartbroken that this administration has decided to say, loudly and clearly, that they believe some young people‚Äôs lives are not worth saving.‚Äù</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Trevor Project emphasized that its own free and confidential crisis services will remain available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for any young LGBTQ individual in need of support.

    "content": "More than $6 million in federal funding for nine non-profit organizations serving LGBTQ people and individuals living with HIV ‚Äî including New York's LGBT Community center ‚Äî has been reinstated for now after <a href=\"https://gaycitynews.com/lgbtq-centers-trump-sue-executive-orders/\">Lambda Legal spearheaded a lawsuit</a> targeting three of the president's executive orders.\n\nThe case of San Francisco AIDS Foundation v. Trump originated in February when the nine organizations, represented by Lambda Legal, filed the federal lawsuit challenging three executive orders signed early in President Donald Trump's term: ‚ÄúDefending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government,‚Äù ‚ÄúEnding Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing,‚Äù and ‚ÄúEnding Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity.‚Äù\n\nIn early June, the US District Court for the Northern District of California <a href=\"https://gaycitynews.com/federal-court-blocks-trump-anti-trans-orders/\">granted a preliminary injunction</a> against several provisions of the three executive orders.\n\nFollowing the executive orders, federal agencies told non-profits that funding would be cut at organizations serving transgender individuals or carrying out \"equity-related\" work, Lambda Legal said when the lawsuit was first filed.\n\nLambda Legal announced on July 15 that the $6.2 million in funding had been restored. Now, the organizations involved in the suit ‚Äî including New York's LGBT Center ‚Äî will be able to continue operating with the federal funds. Other organizations involved in the suit include the Bradbury-Sullivan Community Center in Pennsylvania, Baltimore Safe Haven in Maryland, FORGE in Wisconsin, and Prisma Community Care in Arizona.\n\nThe victory is only temporary as the case continues to proceed. But Lambda Legal is, at least for now, welcoming the restoration of funds.\n\n‚ÄúWe have confirmed that our plaintiffs ‚Äî LGBTQ+ organizations providing critical services to their communities ‚Äî have seen their threatened funding restored,‚Äù Jose Abrigo, senior attorney and HIV Project director at Lambda Legal, said in a written statement. ‚ÄúWhen we fight, we win. We know the battle is far from over and there will be setbacks along the way, but the cause is too important, and the need too great, for us to lose heart.‚Äù\n\nThe initial lawsuit was filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of California and argued that the executive orders violate free speech under the First Amendment as well as the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause and the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. The suit further accused the Trump administration of violating the Administrative Procedures Act.",
